## Writeup

Ryan is a 50-something year old half asian half white dude who has been "doing this for a while". He is an obvious "Loganification" of Ryu.

He doesn't leap during a shoryuken, his fireballs are small, he uses some simple gadgets to help him move around. His shins and forearms have metal braces that he uses to attack.

## Mechanics

Counter hits?

## Moves

### Jab
- [F]
- Quick jab

### Sweep
### Backhand
- Back + [F]
- Similar to Guile's Spinning Back Knuckle

### Parry/super block/?
- [V]
- This has to do *something*

### Hail mary
- Forwards + [V]
- Lunges forwards, somewhat similarly to fafnir
- Can be used mid dash for easy kara like cancel

### Dragon counter
- Dragon punch motion + [V]
- Shoryuken that is also a counter, doesn't go off unless hit during startup
- Pulls the opponent across and launches them in the air

### Fireball
- Quarter Circle Forward + [V]
- Quick and small fireball that goes about half screen or less
- Looks wimpy but can be cancelled into stuff

## Visuals

Salt and pepper (emphasis on the salt) hair and bear, fit for his age, but covered in scars, Dresses simple due to clothes not lasting long in his profession.

## Audio

Juicy, crunchy and gravely

## Flair

Mechanically, the character is a brick. Solid, simple and never fails, but can be used in a variety of ways. A large part of why someone would stick with Ryan is how solid he is. He is an all-rounder who has some unique tricks of his own.

Audiovisually, he has a lot of what makes old man logan interesting.
