# Blocking

Hold 4 or 1 to block. Every move does lethal chip damage.

## Just block

TODO: How narrow?
Start a block in a narrow window before getting hit. Just blocking leads to better **frame advantage**, reduced **push back**,
and no chip damage.

## AJB

TODO: How long does ajb last?
Stands for Auto Just Block. Press 5D to start AJB. Costs 1 zeal to start, but after starting will automatically just block all
strikes for a period of time.

## Push block

Costs 1 zeal. Long but narrow strike that will push the opponent back if not blocked. Has no effect on the opponent if blocked. Deals no damage.

Inputs:
    3B is downwards push block
    6B is horizontal push block
    9B is upwards push block
