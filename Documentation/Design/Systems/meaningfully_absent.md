## Combo scaling

Upsides:
- It emphasizes shorter combos
- It reduces touch of deaths

Downsides:
- Difficult to really understand (did that small hit early mean I did less damage with more hits?)
- Not really visible (sitting new fighting gamers out there I guarantee they don't even notice combo scaling outside training mode numbers)

Workaround:
- Ways to break a combo (Overdrive)


## Running

Upsides:
- Go fast

Downsides:
- You rarely want to go slow, so you just have to jump through extra hoops.

Workaround:
- Every character is always running.
