# Movement

## Running

Use 4 and 6 to run left and right. A character runs faster towards the opponent.

## Jump

Use 7, 8, or 9 to jump. 8 jumps straight up, while 7 and 9 jump diagonally. The jump is intentionally very short, most of the air
mobility should come from air dashes.

## Ground dash

Either double tap 4 or 6 or press 4M or 6M to dash in a direction. Dashes will be good for fast and short adjustments, but running
across the screen is faster than dashing.

## Air dash

Either double tap one of the eight directions or press a direction with M to air dash to that direction. Gravity is reset while
airdashing. An airdash up is roughly twice as long as a jump.

By default a character has two air dashes.

## Super jump

Press 5M while on the ground to super jump. Super jumping should take you about three times as high as a normal jump.

## Hover

Press 5M while in the air to hover stationary for a while. This is basically a stationary air dash.
