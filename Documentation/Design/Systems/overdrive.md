# Overdrive

The overdrive button has multiple situational effects. All the options cost some **zeal**.
Inputting a direction will make your character shift a bit to the direction of the input.

Characters can have their own overdrive effects that may or may not require motion inputs.

## Combo breaker (3 zeal)

If pressed in hit/block stun, launches an AoE blast around you that if not blocked launches the
opponent far away. Deals no damage and takes a while to recover from.

Somewhat punishable on block, but overall a relatively safe option for making yourself a second to think.

## Flash cancel (1 zeal)

If pressed during any part of an attack animation, the rest of that animation is cancelled.

Useful combo tool, as allows for canceling moves that otherwise cannot be canceled.

## Overcharge (1 zeal)

If none of the other situations apply, puts your character in the Overcharge state. In Overcharge,
some of your character's moves gain special properties, but the buff ends the first time you use one of them,
get hit, or after five seconds.
