# Glossary

To keep a consistent terminology. In the rest of the text, stuff that can be found in this document should be bolded.

## Resources

Health - Health of a character. If it gets to 0 you lose.
Zeal - Limited resource for certain actions

## Genre concepts

Stun - A state where a character cannot act
Hitstun - Stun caused by getting struck
Blockstun - Stun caused by blocking, usually shorter than hitstun.
Startup frames - Animation required before a move can affect the opponent
Active frames - The time window where a move can affect the opponent
Recovery frames- Animation after active frames that usually returns your character to the state they were in before the startup frames
Cancel - Interrupting a move before it finishes, usually only the recovery frames can be canceled.
Chip - Damage that gets through blocking
Frame advantage - The difference between recovery frames and block stun caused by a move. If a move inflicts more block stun than it has recovery frames, it has positive frame advantage, if a move recovers for longer than the recipient is in block stun, it has negative frame advantage.
Push back - How far a character is pushed back when they block a strike.
Hitbox - Designated area where a move can deal damage
Hurtbox - Designated area where a character can get hit

## Actions

Strike or Hit - An attack that can be blocked. Not a throw.
Throw - An attack that can't be blocked.
Move - A move is any action the character can take that can inflict damage. Both strikes and throws are moves.
Block - Holding away from the opponent when your character is struck to mitigate most of the damage and hitstun.
Just block - Start blocking in a short window before getting struck. This grants a small advantage.
