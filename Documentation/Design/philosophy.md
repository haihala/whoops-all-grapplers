# Philosophy

## Audience

The game will be a competetive fighting game *mainly* for people who aren't necessarily fighting game players, but are competetive
gamers from other games like CS:GO or LOL.

There will be people who are fighting gamers, but they will be fine with anything as long as the first group is fine with it, and so
while they aren't necessarily secondary, their needs are a subset of the first group's needs

There will be people who don't have experience with competetive games, they are free to learn with the resources provided, but the
game will not provide them a story mode or an arcade mode or fishing minigames or anything to keep the circusgoers entertained.

### Player promises

1. Game will reward good decision making
2. A new fighting game player will be able to execute necessities
3. Game will be visually clear

### Design borders

1. I need to be able to do it mechanically 5 times in a row.
2. A tool for every situation, nothing should be impossible given perfect information for the next five seconds.

## Zen

This is mostly so I can laugh at how wrong I got them later.

Major:

1. No problem is without a tool and no tools without a problem
2. Decision making over execution
3. Go deep before going wide
4. Seeing the mechanic explains the mechanic
5. Mental load is a cost

Minor:

1. If you can't learn a mechanic outside of a match, it shouldn't exist
   1. This is for stuff like s dolphin is -, h dolphin is +. That is unlearnable without someone telling you.
2. If a cool underused mechanic can get highlighted easily, it should be
3. If a button does something sometime, it should do something in neutral.
