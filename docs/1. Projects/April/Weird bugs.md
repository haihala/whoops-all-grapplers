- [ ] Jumps are very high (inconsistently)
	- [ ] See [[Fix execution order]]
- [x] Special interpretation is sometimes kinda tight
- [x] Some inputs are flipped, some aren't
- [x] Knockback next to wall can leave a character in the air
- [ ] Also pressing a button while crouching
	- [x] Maybe fixed with physics rework
	- [ ] Character extends, is grounded so gravity won't apply them, is now max size, but just in the air.
	- [ ] [[Player state refactor]] will likely help with this as it can dedicate a system to crouching
- [ ] Air moves leave a character hanging in the air
- [x] Air moves don't dissapear if it's cancelled by landing
- [x] Knockback only goes up
- [ ] Superjump can't hold down (probably a problem with starting moves from a set)
