These should be made actionable.

# Combat spam
Timing buttons should be insentivized over spam.

Trails of thought to explore later:
- Spam has a cost or timing has a reward
- Spam leads to a different action


# Crouching
- Can you low-profile moves?
- How does crouch-blocking work?
	- Maybe you can't crouch block and the meta is to jump sweeps and duck highs
		- This contradicts the varying character sizes
		- Contradiction isn't as bad if it's just insentivized but not mandatory, if you can low block but moves are usually safe-ish and jumping over leads to easy punishes

# Items
Favor items over universals
- Minimum width, maximum depth
	- Width is amount of levers to pull
	- Depth is the amount of interactions those levers have
- Some things should probably still be universal, but which ones?
