These should be made actionable.

# Combat spam
Timing buttons should be insentivized over spam.

Trails of thought to explore later:
- Spam has a cost or timing has a reward
- Spam leads to a different action

# Attack heights
- Overhead
	- high that hits crouching
	- some faster ones are duckable by the smaller characters
- Mid
- Low

# Items
Favor items over universals
- Minimum width, maximum depth
	- Width is amount of levers to pull
	- Depth is the amount of interactions those levers have
- Some things should probably still be universal, but which ones?

# Buttons
## Guaranteed face buttons
1. Light
2. Heavy
3. Item

## Maybe buttons
1. Grab
2. Dash
3. Cancel
4. Taunt
5. Character specific gimmick
6. Combination of the above
7. Maybe heavy is just double light
	1. Maybe for a character, but this is too harsh to be universal
