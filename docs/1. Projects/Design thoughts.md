These should be made actionable.

# Combat spam
Timing buttons should be insentivized over spam.

Trails of thought to explore later:
- Spam has a cost or timing has a reward
	- Reward over require demands the latter
	- Rewarding some meter on frame perfect (or close enough) presses
		- Simple, effective
		- Reward for those who want it, doesn't hurt to spam but you know better

- Spam leads to a different action
	- This on it's own is cool, but
		- If the input parsing is not quite as lenient as the user would like, feels bad
		- Everything or at least many things would require separate spam functions
		- Inputting spam functions in a combo would kinda suck

# Attack heights
- Overhead
	- high that hits crouching
	- some faster ones are duckable by the smaller characters
- Mid
- Low

# Items
Favor items over universals
- Minimum width, maximum depth
	- Width is amount of levers to pull
	- Depth is the amount of interactions those levers have
- Some things should probably still be universal, but which ones?

# Buttons
## Guaranteed face buttons
1. Light
2. Heavy
3. Item

## Maybe buttons
1. Grab
2. Dash
3. Cancel
4. Taunt
5. Character specific gimmick
6. Combination of the above
7. Maybe heavy is just double light
	1. Maybe for a character, but this is too harsh to be universal

# Space usage
- Space usage mattering beyond just being in the corner or not would be cool
- Air and jumping?
	- Double jump?
- Speed?
	- Leaning on fast
