- Get rid of the tick function
- Make domain specific systems. Performance doesn't matter here
	- One for walking
	- One for jumping
	- One for crouching
	- One for move progression and activation
		- There is a circular dependency issue with this one
		- parser requires state to know which way it's facing
		- state would require parser to know what moves to start up
	- Put all of them in a plugin that you export
- Add a system for more dynamic move phase checks.
	- [[Temporary parser targets]]
	- Parser head like structure for advancing moves and making the meta decisions (keeping track of relevant info)
	- Store that in the activity, as it's a part of that and should vanish if the user gets hit
	- Moves that can trigger in certain states (Rekka)
- Currently doing a move while crouching will nudge the charcter up a bit, causing issues.
