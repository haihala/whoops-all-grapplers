## Low priority
- [[Recovery and knockdown]]
- [[Change detection]]

## Easy nibbles
- Extend meter to resources
	- Bullets go there

## Not a priority
- [[3D model]]
	- [[Animations]]
- [[Counter hits]]
- [[Ending rounds]]
- [[Netplay]]
- [[Resources between rounds]]
- [[Rewards]]
- [[Simple training mode]]
- [[Lex]]
- [[Testing framework v2]]
- [[Move representing]]
- A way to pause the game (look at inspector)
- Generic state based visibility toggler for UI components
- Think about cancellability + moves having hit
	- Currently can't cancel rest of active
- Split move list into multiple bits so you can more easily reuse phases for switches that only modify bits of a phase
- Maybe if player collision used diamond shaped colliders it would be easier to handle sliding off when landing on the other player
