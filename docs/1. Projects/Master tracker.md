# Backlog
## High priority
- [[Character 1]]
	- [[Animations for character 1]]

## Low priority
- [[Rewards]]
- [[Menus]]
- [[Netplay]]
- [[Yoink assets]]
- Resource bars visible sections and use by section

## Easy nibbles
- Make throws use hitboxes (this will make rendering them easier)

## Not a priority
- [[CLI args]]
- [[Toasts in various spots]]
- [[Resources between rounds]]
- [[Recovery and knockdown]]
- [[Lex]]
	- Split movelist generation function
	- Heat
- [[Testing framework v2]]
- A way to pause the game (look at inspector)
- Generic state based visibility toggler for UI components (there is a component for visibility)
- Attributes like startup reduction and stun increase to and from inventory
- [[Stance system]]
- Air dodge (item)
	- Double tap a cardinal to dodge that way
		- Down is an in place dodge
		- Opener bonus is re-applied
- De-couple hit effects from registering a hit
- Figure out a neater way to specify hit properties
- 2 out of the 3 longest files in the project are in input parsing, maybe it could do with a cleanup at some point now that rust is more familiar
