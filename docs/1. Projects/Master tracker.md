# Backlog
## Before playtest
Nice to have:
- [[Items for playtest]]
- Hurtbox padding and adjustments
- Combine items if slots when full
- Fall-backs when player uses a meter move without meter
	- Utility function for specials to fall back when you have no bar.
- Fix throws
	- Weird offset
	- Knockback on back throws
	- Random sideswitches

## [[Feedback round 1]]

## Nice to have
- [[Extending items]]
- [[Toasts in various spots]]
- [[Move format refinement]]
- [[Mizku]] gripes
- An actual loading screen that waits until models are in.
- Upgrades only show things you have the parts for to reduce bloat
	- Or maybe sort more intelligently, something like
		- Purchasable
		- All components owned but can't afford
			- Not sure if I want to do this, as it could cause shifts in the list
		- A component owned
		- No components owned

### Spec update
- Get idea dumps from archive
	- Character
	- Move
- Investigate what good can you get from the archive

## Not a priority
- [[New toys from 0.10]]
- [[Rewards 2.0]]
- [[CLI args]]
- Delay wakeup on knockdown
- [[Menus]]
- [[Testing framework v2]]
- [[Pause and step in dev mode]]
- [[Yoink assets]]
- [[Netplay]]
- [[Try out egui]]
- [[Shop 2.0]]
- [[Dynamic hurtboxes 2.0]]
