- [[Change detection]]

## Easy nibbles
- [[Optimization tracker#Workflow]]
- [[Optimization tracker#Move data]]
- Extend meter to resources
	- Bullets go there
- RunCriteria for specific state transitions

## Not a priority
- [[3D model]]
	- [[Animations]]
- [[Counter hits]]
- [[Ending rounds]]
- [[Netplay]]
- [[Resources between rounds]]
- [[Rewards]]
- [[Simple training mode]]
- [[Shoto girl]]
- [[Testing framework v2]]
- Space to pause the game (look at inspector)
- Generic state based visibility toggler for UI components
- Think about cancellability + moves having hit
	- Currently can't cancel rest of active
- Split move list into multiple bits so you can more easily reuse phases for switches that only modify bits of a phase
