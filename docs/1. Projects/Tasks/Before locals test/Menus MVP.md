For stuff like pause and main menus

- [ ] Dev flag jumps straight to combat
- [ ] End screen
	- [ ] Quit
	- [ ] Rematch
	- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Main menu
	- [ ] Versus (combat)
	- [ ] Dev mode (Enables dev plugin)
	- [ ] Quit
- [ ] Jump to end screen on game over


Order of operations:
1. Try out https://github.com/nicopap/ui-navigation with the end screen
2. Make ending the game transition to end screen
3. Implement the main menu
4. This task is done, more things can come later
