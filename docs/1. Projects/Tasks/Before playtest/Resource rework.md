# Todo
- Take character into account when creating UI
- Render meter as quadrants
	- Color changes
	- Divider lines
- Allow Items to affect special resources

# Original plan
- Make resources more generic
	- Allowing it to be specified in the character struct
	- Character specific things can be put in there
- Maybe have a common struct for resources and restrict the unique behaviours to a field in that struct?
- Types of resources
	- Health?
	- [[Meter]]
		- Rendered as a bar of four segments at the bottom of the screen
		- Used in sections
		- Bar can wrap around with items later on
	- Charge
		- Rendered as a solid bar on top of [[Meter]] that changes colour when full
		- Has
			- A function that returns an a signal enum
				- Clear
				- Retain current level
				- Build (Amount)
				- Drain (Amount)
			- Clear delay (wait this long with just clear signals before clearing)
			- Max charge level
		- Never used as much as it's cleared
		- Moves get a percentage of how much charge you have
	- Stacks
		- Character specific stacks of something
		- Positive integer with an optional max
		- Rendered as a number and an icon
	- Cooldown
		- Not rendered
		- Prevent you from doing a move two times too fast
		- Mostly for [[Gi of the old masters]] spam
		- Can be saved for later
