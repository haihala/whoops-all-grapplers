- Could there be a property generic that evaluates into a value based on a FnOnce that takes the movesituation
	- Maybe you could specify a base phase and a function that transforms that based on the situation
	- This could make it so you don't need a global store for all stats and representing phases that get influence by multiple items easier.
	- Move away from switches for nearly identical phases
		- **Maybe this structure could replace switches entirely?**
- Sidenote: `MoveSituation` ought to include the phase resolution history so that it becomes deterministic
	- Currently it can't handle cases where multiple phases depend on input
	- Re-evaluating for later ones includes the input for previous ones, which causes issues
- Instead of pure phase index, use a combination of index, branch coordinates to determine where the execution of a move is at.
	- This allows to have a window to transition into another action instead of just at action boundary
	- e.g. user can tap gunshot while already shooting and the second shot comes immediately and not after a delay. Holding would still be possible.
