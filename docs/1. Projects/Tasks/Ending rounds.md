# Damage
- Going to 0hp ends the fight to damage
	- Heels gain fans when ending with damage
	- Faces lose fans when ending with damage

# Pinning
- 2G makes you attempt a pin
- Pin does no damage, so trying for a pin is an opportunity cost
- Kicking out of a pin costs health and meter
	- More every time they do it
	- Kicking out creates distance between the players
	- Frame advantage neutral
- Faces gain fans if they win with a pin, lose fans if they win with damage
- Player getting pinned has to make a choice, is kicking out worth the damage they are going to take.
