- Add a special case `MoveAction` that has a switch for `MoveId`
	- For [[Gi of the old masters]] parry window opening
	- For entering [[Stance system]]
- `MoveBuilder` or similar that could make constructing moves a bit less cumbersome. There is some repetition currently and properties that aren't obviously linked when you look at the code but do affect each other.
