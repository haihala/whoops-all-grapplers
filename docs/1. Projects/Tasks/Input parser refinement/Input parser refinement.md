# Nice to have
In order of most to least important
- Re-introduce multipress inputs.
- [[Move activation autocorrection]]
-  Input could be made into a more complicated version
	- Blacklist inputs that instantly clear the input
	- [[Normal and special detector function]]
- [[Sub inputs]]

# Done
- [[Parser batching]]
- [[Generic moves]] - Needed for [[Shop UI]]
- `+` in an input description modifies the previous one, so that it must still be active for the next one to register
