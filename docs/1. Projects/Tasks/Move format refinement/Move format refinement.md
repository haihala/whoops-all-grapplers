# Part 1: Action extention
## Done
- [[Grab system extention]]
- [[Buff container]]
- [[Intangibility on moves]]
- [[Stance system]]

# Part 2: FlowControl extention
- Remove dynamic flow control and replace it with:
	- [[Dynamic actions]]
	- [[Dynamic wait (until)]]

This ought to make calculating when a move will end easier. Certainly makes knowing if such a thing can be known easier.

## Done
- [[Noop in flowcontrol]]


# Part 3: Move structure
- [[Separate hitboxes from phases]]
- [[HitboxBuilder]]
- [[MoveBuilder]]
- [[External events for moves]]
- Could maybe
