# Meter
Meter is for rewarding stuff immediately. Players have 4 bars of meter, used in chunks, but gained slowly.

## Timing bonus
- Links and optimal cancels are rewarded with meter
	- Perfect (or close to) gains a lot
	- Good gains some
	- Outside good there is an area where auto linker works but you don't gain meter.

## Defense
- Theory: Defensive play is boring because it's passive and reactive
- You gain meter for every chained correct defensive option
- Chain ends after a few seconds of not blocking or teching
- First few don't give you anything
- Aims to emphasize varying your options over knowing where the gaps in a sequence are.

### Parry
- [[Clash parry]]
- [[Gi of the old masters]]

# Opener
As a replacement to combo scaling, the first hit gets a boost.

# Money
Money is rewarded for doing cool stuff that isn't directly beneficial for winning.

## Taunting
- Taunting gives money gradually over time
- Interruping the other guy taunting gives you the money they'd get for finishing the taunt
- triple tap down + Gimmick

## Close games
- The more damage you deal, the more money you get
	- Logic is that the match was hype for the provider, sold well, you get a bonus.
- You also get money for taking damage, but not as much, maybe half

## Winning
- Winning importantly doesn't give you money.
- For the organizer, who wins is not important.
