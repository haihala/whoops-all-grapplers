Interlocked with [[Items and the shop]]

- Binds
	- Contextual button to buy or sell depending on what is hovered
	- Directions to move
	- Ready up button
	- Something to move quickly?
		- Shift like button to jump an entire segment
		- Jump doubles?
		- Option for an obscure navigation mode
			- Kinda requires [[CLI args]]

# Other todos
- Update info view
- End shopping
- Apply effects when shopping ends (like increased health from new items)
- Notifications for when the user does something weird

# Architecture brainstorming
- Centralized component to store/write/read state would be cool
	- Referencing said component may be difficult
	- Link after creation?
- How to update buttons?
- How to highlight selected option?
- Where to read input?
