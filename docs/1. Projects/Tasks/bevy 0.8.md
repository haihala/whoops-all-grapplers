Others to note
- Scenebundles instead of a homebrew solution to spawning gltf
- Remove .iter() and .iter_mut() for queries as they implement IntoIter now
- [query::iter_many](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-8/#query-iter-many)
- [hierarchy commands](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-8/#hierarchy-commands)
	- Spawning hitboxes, maybe more
- Check post processing demo for maybe mirroring better
