- Timer font is weird in full screen relative to health bars
- There is a timing bug, presumably when you do a charge move (and consume charge) on the same frame that charge would be lost naturally
- Game crashes when a character is launched
	- Likely due to system ordering and how impulses are done

# Possibly incidentally fixed?
- Figure out how to get rid of panics while despawning hitboxes
- Jumping makes you unable to do any moves
