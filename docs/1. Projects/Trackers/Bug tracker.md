# Still at large
- [ ] Superjump can't hold down (probably a problem with starting moves from a set)
- [ ] Landing on top of the other player has a weird pushing interaction (instantly teleports the players)
- [ ] Game doesn't restart after a player wins
- [ ] Doing a move without mobility from a walk will retain walking velocity

# Brought in dead or alive
- [x] Game crashes on running out of health because already in state
- [x] Jumps are very high (inconsistently)
- [x] Special interpretation is sometimes kinda tight
- [x] Some inputs are flipped, some aren't
- [x] Knockback next to wall can leave a character in the air
- [x] Also pressing a button while crouching
- [x] Air moves leave a character hanging in the air
- [x] Air moves don't dissapear if it's cancelled by landing
- [x] Knockback only goes up
