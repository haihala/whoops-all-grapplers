# Input parsing
- Maybe only store index in parser head
- Add a way to specify that the last stick direction must be present when move is triggering
	- Maybe do this automatically for all normals?
	- Maybe do it outside the parser?

# Waiting for upstream
- Can you use const sin for angles in jumps yet?
- Could you mirror player animation/model with shaders?

# Other
- Pushback should not apply to projectiles
