# Input parsing
- Maybe only store index in parser head
- Automatically check if the last direction of the input is still being held for all normals detected with [[Normal and special detector function]]?

# Waiting for upstream
- Can you use const sin for angles in jumps yet?
- Could you mirror player animation/model with shaders?

# Other
- Pushback should not apply to projectiles
- Newtype wrapper for frames. Currently using usize, which means frames 99% of the time, but not always.
