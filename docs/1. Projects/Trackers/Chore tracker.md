# Input parsing
- Maybe only store index in parser head

# Waiting for upstream
- Can you use const sin for angles in jumps yet?
- Could you mirror player animation/model with shaders?

# Other
- Projectiles should stop if they aren't active aka clashing.
	- Currently fast enough projectiles can pass each other while clashing.
