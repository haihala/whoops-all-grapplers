# Input parsing
- Maybe input parsing could clone less and burrow more
- Maybe only store index in parser head
- Pass previous head as is, but prevent it from activating moves
	- Currently negative edge fails after a long time, as buttons are cleared for previous frame

# Other
- Can you use const sin for angles in jumps yet?
