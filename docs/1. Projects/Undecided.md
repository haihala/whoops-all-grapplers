- What if you had to pin instead of reduce health
	- Maybe a smash like system? Maybe this is a thing in addition to regular health? Maybe there is a minigame.
- What if health didn't fully recover between rounds and you had to buy it
- Go through [[bonuses]] and implement that shit
- Netplay (see: https://johanhelsing.studio/posts/extreme-bevy)

# Think about counter hits
Usually in wrestling people get to do their shit and counters aren't emphasized

Maybe add a toast 'trapped' for situations where a player gets counterhit by a slower move. 

Maybe add 'hard trapped' for situations where they get counterhit and none of their moves would've been fast enough to stuff it.

A third one 'stuffed' that indicates a move was interrupted by another.
