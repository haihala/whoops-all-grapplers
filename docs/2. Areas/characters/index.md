# Characters
- MVP will have one character, Final product will have 10
  - If the amount of characters is known before hand, each one is maybe considered more critically

## Philosophy
1. Every character is someone's baby, treat them all with respect
2. Each character needs a reason to exist.
   1. They serve a player profile that was previously without a character
   2. They bring something completely new to the genre
   3. They are an interesting twist on something
3. There are bad ideas and there are cursed ideas. Course correct early and often.

## Stages
Characters are composed of multiple phases. Mechanics, Moves, visuals, audio, and flair. Before a character is done, each of these parts will go through several phases. A character is done when all the parts are done.

Part phases are 'Blank', 'Started', 'Designed', Implemented', and 'Polished'

Each character file ought to have a matrix like this at the start:

|           | Vision | Started | Designed | Implemented | Polished |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Mechanics | x      |         |          |             |          |
| Moves     | x      |         |          |             |          |
| Visuals   | x      |         |          |             |          |
| Audio     | x      |         |          |             |          |
| Flair     | x      |         |          |             |          |

One X per line, when all lines have an X at polished, the character is done.

## Idea dump
If a character has a name or more than 3 lines, they need a file of their own. Copy [[template]] and change the name. Add a page to the excel that holds move importance.

- Charge move that requires expiring charge (Can't hold too long)
- 6w as a reversal grab parry where a character grabs an incoming high attack
- Dashes
	- Teleport
	- Wavedash with attacks
	- Slide with 323 or 121
- Counter hit character with slow moves but you can block during the first few startup frames
- Dirty boxer (Has a gun in one glove) Maybe something that can't be reloaded)
- Traditionally aquaman sucks. The ocean character should be cool. Maybe a lovecraft thing with the power of the deep. 
	- Needs to signal power, similar to how Potemkin makes the ground shake just by walking
- Damage over time status effect with long setup (garuda)
- Armor plane (not whole body armor just like a shield)
- Passive armor that regenerates every 10s or so
- Press button multiple times for a strong attack
- Hold button for a strong attack
- Negative edge
- Area specific hits
	- Headshots add hitstun, gutshots reduce meter gain
- Gain a character specific resource by canceling moves
- Catch and release projectiles
- Psychopath that is not evil (maybe in a relationship with another character)
- Wave dash
- A physics object that swings around the character (attack by moving)
- Back and forth dash canceling
- "Batman" with many gadgets and gizmos that are single use
- Proper shoryuken with inverse input that rekka's into downwards shoriyuken (normal input)
- "Young, brute force shoto"
  - Instead of a reversal dp, they may have a massive dp that is just hugely negative on block.
- Rubber arms grappler
- Goldlewis like glasses, but they give information to the player (maybe show like ghosts of predicted moves from the opponent)
- Vampire glass cannon (low max health, lifesteal)
- Controllable dragon summon
- Arrogant swordsmith
  - Add card gambling?
  - Many different swords. Leaves a mark on you with one where they bet some life they can get a hit in fast.
- Axl but if opponent is too close you leash to them and maybe lose access to some attacks
  - Call something between axl rose and axel foley
- Ultimate shield
  - A designated turtle with several counters and get off me moves.
  - Very important, no tools beyond mid range to retaliate
  - Health regen?
  - How do they win?
- Air specialist
  - rarely touches the ground
  - Up charges
- A character with actually decent install
  - Thinking barbarian rage that makes it their turn for like a third of the round straight, but comes with a heavy drawback later
