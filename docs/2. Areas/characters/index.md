# Characters
## Philosophy
1. Every character is someone's baby, treat them all with respect
2. Each character needs a reason to exist.
   1. They serve a player profile that was previously without a character
   2. They bring something new to the game
3. There are bad ideas and there are cursed ideas. Course correct early and often.

## Idea dump
If a character has a name or more than 3 lines, they need a file of their own. Copy [[template]] and change the name. The idea list below is rarely if ever groomed. They probably should be. Only read if highly motivated.

- Characters have small strings of music attached to some of their combos
	- Like a few hit combo that sounds like the start of the american national anthem
- Character with a miniquest mechanic where they get rewarded for completing quests
	- Each quest has a progress bar and the joke is to have super many bars
- Character who is kinda bad but they get bonus money because they are rich
- Forward charge, back+button = parry or a reposte
- Whip attack that is a hit far up, grab close up and has a dead zone in the middle where it's a movement slowing very negative whiff
- Two step guard crush, the first puts on a status that makes you take more chip, the second opens you up.
- Samurai with the motto "measure twice, cut once" each blocked non-mid and each parry increase a counter. Has a slow heavy slash type of move, that deals damage based on stacks. Very punishable on block.
- Slow lazy character with massive muscles and equally massive damage
- Upside down quarter that has two variants depending on if you do it grounded or not
- 693 as an overhead input (heavy smash)
- Move that enters a commital mixup-rekka state
	- You can't move
	- You have fast and slow low and overhead (four moves)
	- Can use options in any order
	- Max like 5 hits
	- Can end at any time
	- Each input makes it more punishable
	- Getting an option blocked puts a status on you where you take more damage on the next hit
		- Getting all 5 blocked makes you instantly die on the first hit
- Charge move that requires expiring charge (Can't hold too long)
- 6w as a reversal grab parry where a character grabs an incoming high attack
- Dashes
	- Teleport
	- Wavedash with attacks
	- Slide with 323 or 121
- Counter hit character with slow moves but you can block during the first few startup frames
- Dirty boxer (Has a gun in one glove) Maybe something that can't be reloaded)
- Traditionally aquaman sucks. The ocean character should be cool. Maybe a lovecraft thing with the power of the deep. 
	- Needs to signal power, similar to how Potemkin makes the ground shake just by walking
- Damage over time status effect with long setup (garuda)
- Armor plane (not whole body armor just like a shield)
- Passive armor that regenerates every 10s or so
- Press button multiple times for a strong attack
- Hold button for a strong attack
- Negative edge
- Area specific hits
	- Headshots add hitstun, gutshots reduce meter gain
- Gain a character specific resource by canceling moves
- Catch and release projectiles
- Psychopath that is not evil (maybe in a relationship with another character)
- Wave dash
- A physics object that swings around the character (attack by moving)
- Back and forth dash canceling
- "Batman" with many gadgets and gizmos that are single use
- Proper shoryuken with inverse input that rekka's into downwards shoriyuken (normal input)
- Rubber arms grappler
- Goldlewis like glasses, but they give information to the player (maybe show like ghosts of predicted moves from the opponent)
- Vampire glass cannon (low max health, lifesteal)
- Controllable dragon summon
- Arrogant swordsmith
  - Add card gambling?
  - Many different swords. Leaves a mark on you with one where they bet some life they can get a hit in fast.
- Axl but if opponent is too close you leash to them and maybe lose access to some attacks
  - Call something between axl rose and axel foley
- Ultimate shield
  - A designated turtle with several counters and get off me moves.
  - Very important, no tools beyond mid range to retaliate
  - Health regen?
  - How do they win?
- Air specialist
  - rarely touches the ground
  - Up charges
- A character with actually decent install
  - Thinking barbarian rage that makes it their turn for like a third of the round straight, but comes with a heavy drawback later
