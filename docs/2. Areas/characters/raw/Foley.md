## Writeup
Son of Ryan and a jazz singer, grew up with his dad who wasn't really that supportive, but wanted a mini-me

## Mechanics

### Notes
All of Foley's attacks are mapped to one of four notes.

### Riffs
Landing certain attacks with the correct notes in a correct timing to perform a riff.

Successfully performing a riff will yield a bonus.

Riffs:
* We will rock you by Queen
* Fizzbuzz riff from Dylan Beatie

## Moves

### Counter
A counter that is activated after getting hit and reverses time back to when you were not hit

### Care package
A move to send something back in time, maybe one to receive (closed time loops)

Don't force the design if it isn't coming out

## Visuals
Gary Clark Jr vibes

## Audio

## Flair
