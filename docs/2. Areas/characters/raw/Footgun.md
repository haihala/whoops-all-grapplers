## Writeup

## Mechanics
Literal guns for feet. Those need to be reloaded. They have specialized bullets:
- Regular
- Explosive (Low range, high spread)
- Stun (Low damage high hitstun)
- Knockback (Low damage fast startup)
QCF+V accesses one leg, QCB+V the other. If a shot is loaded, it shoots. If not, a reload happens

Reloading maybe uses a secondary 'dialog' to choose ammo type.
