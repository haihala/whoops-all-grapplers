# Blocking
Hold back to block. Every move does lethal chip damage. Blocking height is dynamic. Same attack can be a high for a small character and a mid for big character.

There is no air blocking.

## Attack heights
- Overhead
	- high that hits crouching
	- some faster ones are duckable by the smaller characters
- Mid
- Low
