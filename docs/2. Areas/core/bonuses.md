# Opener
Instead of combo scaling, the initial hit gets a damage buff

Backdash while in the first few frames of opener will negate bonus with reduced backdash movement and a 'grazed' notifier instead of 'opener'

# Timing
If a button is timed instead of spammed, the player gets the timing bonus, which gives some [[meter]]

# What to reward
Potential things that can happen in a fighting game:
- Walking
	- Back
	- Forward
- Dashing
	- Back
	- Forward
- Jumping
- Attacking
	- Whiffing
	- Landing
	- Getting blocked
	- Counter hit
- Throwing
- Cancel
	- Jump cancel
	- Dash cancel
	- Special cancel

Behavior that can happen in a fighting game:
- Neutral
- Comboing
- Getting comboed
- Mashing buttons
- Timing buttons
- Zoning
- Rushdown
- RPS
	- Oki

Reward the behavior you want in the situations you think are interesting. Reward over penalty. Also don't reward rewards. There is no point in giving meter based on combo damage, at least directly. Rewards should try to influence gameplay based on the preferred behavior.

It's meant to be a fake hype show, so reward hype shit

Ideas:
- Reward not mashing out combos
	- Detect mashing by seeing if events expire
- Parrying
- New moves in a combo
	- Long non-repetetive comboes
- Good neutral
	- More hit stun on the first hit
	- More damage on the second hit (conversions)
	- Heighten the tension by increasing the aformentioned as time goes on.
