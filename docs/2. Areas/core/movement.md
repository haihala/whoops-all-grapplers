# Movement
## Running
Walk backwards, run forwards. Run has some acceleration time.

## Jump
Use up to jump. The jump is intentionally short, most of the air mobility should come from air dashes.

## Ground dash
Double tap to dash in a direction. Dashes will be good for fast and short adjustments, but running across the screen is faster than dashing. This is done by the dash having a long recovery that is cancellable with anything.

Every character has a ground dash. For some it consumes meter, for some it doesn't really move and is moreso a dodge, but everyone has the input.

## Air dash
Double tap one of the four cardinal directions to air dash to that direction. Gravity is reset while airdashing. An airdash up is roughly twice as long as a jump.

By default a character has two air dashes.
