- Space usage mattering beyond just being in the corner or not would be cool

Big questions:
- Double jump
- Air blocking
- Airdash
- Speed of movement

Feelings for the time being
- Going fast would facilitate hazards at the ends
- Jump duration is adjustable separately of height, so it can be made fast and use a lot of vertical space
- Fast is not better, but more exciting
