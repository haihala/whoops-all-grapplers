The game is secretly professional wrestling. This factors into the aesthetic as it's a bit 'tekken' in the "Pop star fights a cyborg"-sense.

It is meant to be a bit silly on one level, but the players are shown (in comics etc) the characters interact with each other while not on stage to ground it. There ought to be a very clear split between the on stage characters and the real people portraying them.
