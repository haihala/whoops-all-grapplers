# Philosophy
## Audience
The game will be a competetive fighting game *mainly* for people who aren't necessarily fighting game players, but are competetive gamers from other games like CS:GO or LOL.

There will be people who are fighting gamers, but they will be fine with anything as long as the first group is fine with it, and so while they aren't necessarily secondary, their needs are a subset of the first group's needs

There will be people who don't have experience with competetive games, they are free to learn with the resources provided, but the game will not provide them a story mode or an arcade mode or fishing minigames or anything to keep the circusgoers entertained.

### Player promises
1. Game will reward good decision making
2. A new fighting game player will be able to execute necessities
3. Game will be visually clear
4. Solving genre problems
5. Genre trope subversion

### Design borders
1. I need to be able to do it mechanically 5 times in a row.
2. A tool for every situation, nothing should be impossible given perfect information for the next five seconds.

## Zen
This is mostly so I can laugh at how wrong I got them later.

1. Reward don't require
2. Net positive fun
	2. Dropping a combo is sad for attacker, neutral for defender, net negative
3. No problem is without a tool and no tools without a problem
4. Decision making over execution
5. Go deep before going wide
	1. When adding ideas, prefer characters over universals (complex characters over many universals)
6. Seeing the mechanic explains the mechanic
   1. This is for stuff like s and h dolphins are different
   2. That is unlearnable without someone telling you.
7. Mental load is a cost
8. The obvious answer should be the best answer
   1. If you can tech throws, it should usually be the best way to avoid them 
9. The fewer special cases the better
12. If a cool underused mechanic can get highlighted easily, it should be
13. If a button does something sometime, it should do something in neutral.
14.  If something conflicts with the rest of the zen and is explained with convention, it needs to go or be reconstructed,


## Reward vs Requirement
Players have a default answer. Doing nothing, blocking, whatever it may be. If the default option is very bad for them in a situation, they need to do or know something. This is a requirement. If the default is only slightly negative or neutral, but they can do something to make it better, they perceive it as a reward.

Players like getting rewards and too many requirements is off-putting.

## Definition of done
Done does not mean finished or immutable.

A character design is done when all of the character's parts are done, see `Characters/index.md`

A systems mechanic is done when:
- It can be explained in three bullets
- It fixes a problem or enhances gameplay
- It doesn't have any obvious problems
- It doesn't clash with player promises

## What makes WAG special
- The items system
- Tight and fast gameplay. Strive for almost a duck game esque speed.
