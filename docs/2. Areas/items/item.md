# Basics
## What
You can buy items that make your character better between rounds. Money is earned through meter spared and damage dealt.

- Some items are character unique
- Some are passive, some go into one of the per input active slots
	- (`4i`, `5i`, `623i`, etc)
	- Some things sharing slots means you sometimes have to pick
		- Balance mechanism, albeit probably smart to avoid changing too often

## Why
- Player expression
- Covering for bad matchups
- Interesting ways to characterize with character specific items items

# Idea dump
- Balrog vskill 2 (no charge required for a charge move)
	- Buy it, you can do charge moves without charge, if you do it consumes the item
- Steel toed boots, block one low per round you would've gotten hit by
- Custom combo like mechanic where yoiu play back your own moves at fractions of speed speed
