# Basics
## What
You can buy items that make your character better between rounds. Money is earned through meter spared and damage dealt.

- Some items are character unique
- Some are passive, some go into one of the per input active slots
	- (`4i`, `5i`, `623i`, etc)
	- Some things sharing slots means you sometimes have to pick
		- Balance mechanism, albeit probably smart to avoid changing too often

## Why
- Player expression
- Covering for bad matchups
- Interesting ways to characterize with character specific items items

# Idea dump
- Balrog vskill 2 (no charge required for a charge move)
	- Buy it, you can do charge moves without charge, if you do it consumes the item
- Steel toed boots, block one low per round you would've gotten hit by
- Custom combo like mechanic where yoiu play back your own moves at fractions of speed speed
- winged shield, gives you a shitty air block and has a flavor text reference to the Bloodborne wooden shield
- Burst that doesn't have a use restrictive use limitation, but every time you use it a bag of money is thrown to the other player's side
	- Bursting on left right mix is very efficient
	- Limit it so that endgame you don't burst on every hit (maybe if you have enough money you just win by capitalism)
