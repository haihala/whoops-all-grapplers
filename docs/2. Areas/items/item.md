# Items
- Some items are character unique
- Some are passive, some go into one of the per input active slots
	- (`4e`, `5e`, `623e`, etc)
	- Some things sharing slots means you sometimes have to pick

A good item should be:
- Interesting
- Complexity increasing
- Non-mandatory
	- It's fine to have a few items, one of which you'd really kinda need to get in a matchup
	- Single must have items are not kosher

Do this with lateral items. here should be an item that kinda solves that problem for every problem, likely several

List of problems:
- Can't block the mixup
	- strike-throw
	- high-low
	- left-right
- Zoning
	- Can't get past
	- Can't keep at bay
- Pressure
	- Can't escape
	- Can't find an opening
- Neutral
	- Can't reach
	- Can't force whiffs
- Can't gain resources
	- Money
	- Meter
- Health
	- Can't kill fast enough
	- Can't survive their combos

How do you force a mistake
- Fundimentally, bait and read
	- Bait them by fainting weakness
	- Read when they are going to bite
- Canceling an unsafe move into a more unsafe move
	- Bait by not doing the cancel
	- Read when they are going to bite, do the cancel
	- Cash out
- Open
	- Why would someone bite?
		- Frustration
		- Desperation
		- Naivety
	- Trying to force a mistake can in an of itself be a mistake if the receiving player has an out the attacker isn't aware of.
		- Items serve two purposes, give outs and create uncertain situations

# Idea dump
- Balrog vskill 2 (no charge required for a charge move)
	- Buy it, you can do charge moves without charge, if you do it consumes the item
- Steel toed boots, block one low per round you would've gotten hit by
- Custom combo like mechanic where yoiu play back your own moves at fractions of speed speed
- winged shield, gives you a shitty air block and has a flavor text reference to the Bloodborne wooden shield
- Burst that doesn't have a use restrictive use limitation, but every time you use it a bag of money is thrown at the other player
	- Bag may miss
	- Limit it so that endgame you don't burst on every hit (maybe if you have enough money you just win by capitalism)
- Air dodge (item)
	- Double tap a cardinal to dodge that way
		- Down is an in place dodge
		- Opener bonus is re-applied
