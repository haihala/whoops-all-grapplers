# Character concepts
## Interesting
- Doctor Facilier(big bad from the princess and the frog) looking guy who is one part
	- The undertaker
	- Big body grappler
	- Voodoo witch doctor
		- Hitting certain moves puts hexes on the opponent
		- Certain moves can consume hexes for benefits
			- Tools to help in neutral or get better OKI
				- Tager magnetism
				- Teleport
				- Long poke
				- Root the opponent
		- More hexes consumed -> At least linear if not exponential power increase
		- Main command grab will automatically do a full cash out
			- It has the best hex to damage ratio
			- Low damage without hexes
## Raw
- Escanor looking motherfucker
	- **The** big brawler guy
	- Deliberately chooses to not "Cheat". 
		- They acknowledge that they would have it easier but choose to do it right
	- Instead they compensate with an insane grindset
- Character who gets that good damage only from anti-airs (tip of anti-air has special props?) and then plays an oppressive death by a thousand cuts ground game
- Robot character that heavily uses weird quirks of computer naming in their items (like how HandL sounds like handle)
- Bad boy sumo guy
- Kaizen (continuous improvement in japanese) as the name of a character
- Zoner that gives you a damage buff that gets reset on whiff and when getting hit

# Moves
- Move with negative startup, causes rollback on activation
- Soul assumption like move that deals damage based on damage taken recently
	- Counts damage taken by both players
	- Pair it with a move that works like oracle heal
- Burst that is faster / larger the longer the combo
- Move where you repeatedly do qcb+button to gain stocks. Use stocks for a big punch (can cancel into punch from wind-ups, better if you do)
- 5653 motion for a sliding dash
- Axe kick that hits mid going up. If it does the attack ends. Hard hitting overhead when coming down. Works as an anti-air when it hits at the apex
- Dash move with a wind-up. You can hold the wind-up for more distance. Has two variants. One is a shorter dash followed by a forward slash, the other is basically alpha blade.
	- Think chainsaw man katana man
- 14563 as an input for a lil hop move

# Items
- Vague ideas
	- Item that is only purchasable if your character has a low winrate globally.
	- Employee handbook that grants some basic ability to newbies that most characters start with.
	- Shoe lube - Walk immediately accelerates to max speed and holds that while doing other actions for about half a second (microwalks gain a lot of distance)
	- Bootleg functions series
		- Item names are scuffed marvel characters like "Magnet man" for magneto
		- They grant a move / trait that is commonly associated with that character in mvc
		- For example: Magnet man would grant an 8-way airdash
	- Monkey picture - Does nothing but take up a slot and fluctuate in price (trending downwards, but can occasionally be sold for profit)
- Consumable
	- Pre-workout
		- Consumed at round start
		- Start the round with a full bar
		- Cost ineffective, but sometimes it'll let you snowball
- Basics with no upgrades
- Basics with upgrades
	- Damage increase (+1 damage per hit ought to be plenty)
	- Feather - Gives you some air control
		- Influence lessens over air time
		- Holding a direction will slowly move you that way
			- Holding up -> Higher jump
			- Tap up and then hold down for a shallower jump
	- Shield - Makes you not able to die to chip damage
	- Stopwatch - Better [[Link bonus]]
		- Minimal effect on the less precise levels
	- Hockey pads - Increases [[Health]]
		- Base for [[Armor]] moves
	- Jar of ectoplasm - [[Intangible]] on the first few frames of a back dash
		- Base for things that make you [[Intangible]]
- Upgrades
	- Shield + Feather => Feathered shield 
		- Lets you air-block one hit
		- It shouldn't be that great. Reference the shield from Bloodborne
	- [[Boots]] upgrades
		- There are many and you are somewhat losing value for buying multiple
		- +Shield = Escape plan
			- Invincible backdash
			- Not thrilled about using the shield for this, as it's less blocking and more evading
		- +Feather = Air jordans
			- Double jump
		- +Defence item = Steel tipped boots
			- Less damage from low attacks
		-  +Stopwatch = Full assault
			- Allow you to dash cancel by spending as much meter as the cancel requires
			- Full Assault Dash Cancel is conveniently fadc
	- 2x Defence item = Hardhat
		- Less damage from overheads

## If the right character comes along
- Jumper cables. Allows you to do electrics with special moves with frame perfect inputs
- Burst that throws a bag of money at the enemy
	- Bag can miss
	- Opponent may collect the bag

## Big undertaking, maybe not
- Custom combo like mechanic
