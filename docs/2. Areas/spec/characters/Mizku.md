**Mizuki**. In Japanese the word _mizu_ means “felicitous omen, auspicious” and the word ki means “hope,” forming this very cool and beautiful girls’ name.

Nicknamed Mizku because it sounds like Masku which is funny Tekken meme.
# Lore
She is a young but competent second generation Korean American immigrant. She's a rookie in [[W.A.G.]] and thus often agrees to do stuff that she really shouldn't including her Japanese samurai gimmick. 

# Motifs
- Samurai gimmick
	- Visual indicators
		- Samurai outfit
		- Oni mask
		- [[#Kunai]]s
		- Katana
	- Effectiveness through effort and practice
		- [[#Sharpness]] mechanic
		- Kurosawa-esque staredowns
- Born and raised in the states
	- Millennial economy
		- A lot of her staple items are consumable
		- Her permanent upgrades are comparatively expensive
	- Occasionally brash
		- [[#Sway]] is essentially a taunt
		- **Laid back**, take cues from Baiken in animations.
		- Can bite her in the ass and be a bit cocky
- Her samurai gimmick comes in part from [[W.A.G.]], she is clearly rebelling against it
- [[#Place in the roster]] indicates she's "the Ryu", but she has a very non-Ryu kit

# Place in the roster
- She will be the anchor in terms of balance.
	- All other characters ought to be balanced around her 
- Strengths
	- Hard reads => hit hard
	- Can grind meter with [[Link bonus]] on [[#Sharpen]]
	- She's good at making you play her game
		- If you spam projectiles full screen, she has time to [[#Sharpen]]
		- If you approach, you'll have to play the close range game with high stakes
- Weaknesses
	- Effectiveness depends on [[#Sharpness]] stacks
	- No natural projectiles, [[#Kunai]] gets expensive to spam
	- Meh pokes

# Mechanics
## Sharpness
- Stacks up to 10
- [[#Sharpen]] adds one stack
- Having stacks makes sword moves like [[#Rising sun]] do more damage
- Resets between rounds

# Moves (built-in)
### Normals
#### Knee thrust
- Input: `f` while standing
- Visual: Lily st.lk, but goes a bit higher
- Function: Abare, Clash parry trigger

#### Low poke
- Input: `f` while crouching
- Visual: Urien cr.lk
- Function: Low check

#### Falcon knee
- Input: `f` while in the air
- Visual: Nago j.k
- Function: Jump-in, pressure, air to air, combo starter
- Two hitboxes, knee and back leg
	- Knee
		- Quite active
		- Hits harder during the first active frame
		- Due to the angle, hits rather low -> Easy to anti-air
	- Back leg
		- Can hit cross up similar to Kum j.d

#### Donkey kick
- Input: `s` while standing
- Visual: Ryu donkey kick from 3s (has the back step)
- Function: Long range high commitment whiff punish / Neutral skip

#### Uppercut
- Input: `s` while Crouching
- Visual: Step back leg forward into back arm uppercut
- Function: Anti-air, combo starter
- Doesn't go that far vertically
- Slightly - on block

#### Foot dive
- Input: `s` while in the air
- Visual: Dr Doom foot dive
- Function: Alters jump arc, combo and pressure starter
- Can be held
	- Hangs in the air a bit
	- Can bait anti-airs

#### Ground throw
- Input: `w` while standing
- Visual: Grab the collar, drag it down and sweep the leg
- Keeps you close for oki

#### Sweep
- Input: `w` while crouching
- Hits low
- Punishable on block
- Knockdown on hit
- Reaches relatively far
- Aight damage for a single hit

#### Air throw
- Input: `w` while in the air
- Like [[#Back throw]], but hold the knees on lapels pose until landing

#### Sharpen
- Input: `g` while on the ground
- Visual: In one smooth movement, take the sword out, run it by a whetstone, put it back
- Gain a point of [[#Sharpness]] and some [[Meter]]

### Specials
#### Rising sun
- Input: `[789]` + `s`
- Visual: Falke SFV reversal
- Functions: Anti-air, combo ender, hard read, whiff punish
	- `f` version is faster, but less damaging, leaning into anti-air / whiff punish
		- Can maybe block punish some things
	- `s` version is slower, leaning more into combo ender / hard read tool
- Air and ground versions
	- Air version exists to lessen the frustration on upwards motions
	- Ground version will recover faster, giving you oki or [[#Sharpen]]
- Death on block and whiff
	- Decent range, not trivial to whiff punish
- Pretty nice chip damage

#### Sway
Conveniently, shortened to bs (bullshit)

- Input: `214` + `f` or `s`
- Visual: Dandy step
- Function: Lots
	- Bait whiffs
	- Extend combos
	- Mix up the opponent
	- Apply pressure on wakeup
	- Cancel long recovery of normals
- Steps
	- Start
		- Swing back and crouch down a bit
	- Dash
		- Press the button that didn't start the back sway to dash forward
			- `f` if you started with `214s` and vice versa
		- Can delay the dash or dash immediately
			- This will change the position one ends up
	- Cancel
		- Press G to cancel
		- Cancel into a short animation that returns to neutral
	- Strike
		- 2W - low slide
		- 6W - Overhead
		- 5W - Pilebunker
- If you use the enhanced version, you get:
	- Longer and faster back movement
	- Longer and faster forward dash
	- G - Cancel works after forward dash

Item ideas:
- Jump cancellability
- Re-dash - Lets you cancel either version before an ender to enhanced back sway
- Just frame timings like SFV Karen Tenko
- Make cancel stop momentum

# Items
- [[Kunai]]
- [[Travel whetstone]]
- [[Gentleman's pipe]]
- [[Spiked shoes]]

# Item ideas
## Armguards
- Upgrade from hockey pads (see [[Idea dump#Items]])
- One hit of [[Armor]] to [[#Rising sun]]

## Dancing shoes
- Upgrade from [[Boots]]
- Add a follow up to [[#Sway]], where you can cancel into the other version of [[#Sway]]
- This is the fastest way to move back if done optimally
	- How the variants have different animation lengths, that's not trivial

## Bag of marshmallow
- Basic item
- If you have down charge, [[#Rising sun]] gains
	- More damage
	- Better vertical knockback for juggles
- Charge is a sliding scale
- With the added juggle height, you get more time
	- Without charge
		- Ground - You have enough time to get oki or [[#Sharpen]]
		- Air - You're safe, but get no oki
	- With max charge
		- Air - Same as chargeless ground version
		- Ground - You can juggle into something on sufficiently high hits
			- One of those cases where you can get a hit in, but it's probably just better to use the time to setup a real mix on oki
			- As a combo tool, instantly cancelled `f`[[#Sway]] should be better
- Item name is referencing the marshmallow test
	- Not exactly great

## Four tiger sword
- While holding [[#Sway]], follow up attacks charge up in power
- Hold for 1s for max power, can release early for partial buff
- Variants
	- Mid becomes unblockable at max charge
	- Low launches
	- All variants gain a damage boost
- Item is referencing Kum (this name fits better even if the reference is hayabusa)

# Moves from [[#Items]]
## Kunai throw
- Input: `236g`
- Visual: Ibuki kunai throw in SFV
- Function: Projectile
	- Relatively fast and small projectile with a slight arc to it
	- Consumes a [[#Kunai]] on use, can't use if you have none
- Maybe add an air version later?

## Rope dart
- Very raw idea, not sure how it would work, but it fits the visual identity and could be interesting
