**Mizuki**. In Japanese the word _mizu_ means “felicitous omen, auspicious” and the word ki means “hope,” forming this very cool and beautiful girls’ name.

# Lore
She is a young but competent second generation Korean American immigrant. She's a rookie in [[W.A.G.]] and thus often agrees to do stuff that she really shouldn't including her Japanese samurai gimmick. 

# Motifs
- Samurai gimmick
	- Visual indicators
		- Samurai outfit
		- Oni mask
		- [[#Kunai]]s
		- Katana
	- Effectiveness through effort and practice
		- [[#Sharpness]] mechanic
		- Kurosawa-esque staredowns
- Born and raised in the states
	- Millennial economy
		- A lot of her staple items are consumable
		- Her permanent upgrades are comparatively expensive
	- Occasionally brash
		- [[#Back step]] is essentially a taunt
		- **Laid back**, take cues from Baiken in animations.
		- Can bite her in the ass and be a bit cocky
- Her samurai gimmick comes in part from [[W.A.G.]], she is clearly rebelling against it
- [[#Place in the roster]] indicates she's "the Ryu", but she has a very non-Ryu kit

# Place in the roster
- She will be the anchor in terms of balance.
	- All other characters ought to be balanced around her 
- Strengths
	- Hard reads => hit hard
	- Can grind meter with [[Link bonus]] on [[#Sharpen]]
	- She's good at making you play her game
		- If you spam projectiles full screen, she has time to [[#Sharpen]]
		- If you approach, you'll have to play the close range game with high stakes
- Weaknesses
	- Effectiveness depends on [[#Sharpness]] stacks
	- No natural projectiles, [[#Kunai]] gets expensive to spam
	- Meh pokes

# Mechanics
## Sharpness
- Stacks up to 10
- [[#Sharpen]] adds one stack
- Having stacks makes sword moves like [[#Upwards slice]] and some [[#Back step]] follow-ups do
	- More damage on hit and block
	- Less horizontal knockback
- Stacks lost (on hit or [[Clash parry]] / on block)
	- `f`: Up to 2 / Up to 5
	- `s`: Up to 3 / all

- Knockdown on hit
- Reaches relatively far
- Aight damage for a single hit

#### Air throw
- Input: `w` while in the air

#### Sharpen
- Input: `g` while on the ground
- Visual: In one smooth movement, take the sword out, run it by a whetstone, put it back
- Add a point of [[#Sharpness]]

### Specials
#### Upwards slice
- Input: `[123]4[89]` + `f` or `s`
- Visual: Falke SFV reversal
- Functions: Anti-air, combo ender, hard read, whiff punish
	- `f` version is faster, but less damaging, leaning into anti-air / whiff punish
		- Can maybe block punish some things
	- `s` version is slower, leaning more into combo ender / hard read tool
- Air and ground versions
	- Air version exists to lessen the frustration on upwards motions
	- Ground version will recover faster, giving you oki or [[#Sharpen]]
- Death on block and whiff
	- Decent range, not trivial to whiff punish
- Pretty nice chip damage

#### Back step
Conveniently, shortened to bs (bullshit)

- Input: `214` + `f` or `s`
- Visual: Dandy step, but she has a coat that follows the motion
- Function: Bait whiffs, extend combos
- Step back, hang back a bit, lunge forward
	- She can perform a follow up at any point during that
- Follow-ups
	- You can activate follow ups whenever in the animation
	- This means you can use the follow-ups on frame 1 and even gain forward momentum
	- All of the follow ups exit the stance where you can do them
	- **Some of the follow-up ideas should be made into items**
	- Options
		- X = release the button you started the move with
		- `[147]X` - Cancel
			- Can be used like a mist finer cancel
			- Done automatically after a second in stance
			- Will persist your momentum somewhat
				- If you do nothing, she'll slide forward after the move
		- `[56]X` - Vertical sword slice
			- Fast and has great reach
		- `[23]X` - Downwards sword slice
			- Hits low, knocks down
		- `[89]X` - Upwards sword slice
			- Covers a lot of space
			- Most punishable of them all
- Versions
	- `f` version
		- Doesn't go that far back, maybe 1m
		- Can be immediately cancelled out of
			- If cancelled out of immediately, doesn't move you back
		- Main function: "Mist finer cancel"
		- Core skill of playing her: When can you get away with doing a `f` version
			- As it moves you back less, you have better control over your movements if you use it over the `s` version
			- Won't go as far, you can get clipped by things you're trying to whiff punish
	- `s` version
		- Goes further back, maybe 2m
			- Can't be cancelled out of before moving back like half of that
		- Main function: Bait and punish whiffs
		- More damage on follow-ups

# Items
## Kunai
- Consumable item that stacks up to 5
- Gives her access to [[#Kunai throw]]

## Armguards
- Upgrade from hockey pads (see [[Idea dump#Items]])
- One hit of [[Armor]] to [[#Upwards slice]]

## Dancing shoes
- Upgrade from [[Boots]]
- Add a follow up to [[#Back step]], where you can cancel into the other version of [[#Back step]]
- This is the fastest way to move back if done optimally
	- How the variants have different animation lengths, that's not trivial

## Travel whetstone
- Basic item
- Can special cancel into [[#Sharpen]]
	- Doing so will end your turn, good option when it's not clear if a starter will hit

## Turtle holster
- Upgrade from feather (see [[Idea dump#Items]])
- Can input a direction when using [[#Kickflip]] to change the angle
- Could use a better name, current one is referencing Oro

## Vampire coffin
- Upgrades from jar of ectoplasm (see [[Idea dump#Items]])
- You gain [[Intangible]] when moving back with [[#Back step]]
- Name is referencing Slayer and keeping with the spooky theme of [[Intangible]] items

## Bag of marshmallow
- Basic item
- If you have down charge, [[#Upwards slice]] gains
	- More damage
	- Better vertical knockback for juggles
- Charge is a sliding scale
- With the added juggle height, you get more time
	- Without charge
		- Ground - You have enough time to get oki or [[#Sharpen]]
		- Air - You're safe, but get no oki
	- With max charge
		- Air - Same as chargeless ground version
		- Ground - You can juggle into something on sufficiently high hits
			- One of those cases where you can get a hit in, but it's probably just better to use the time to setup a real mix on oki
			- As a combo tool, instantly cancelled `f`[[#Back step]] should be better
- Item name is referencing the marshmallow test

# Moves from [[#Items]]
## Kunai throw
- Input: `236g`
- Visual: Ibuki kunai throw in SFV
- Function: Projectile
- Consumes a [[#Kunai]] on use, can't use if you have none
- Air version
	- Diagonal angle
	- Bounces her up some and slightly back
- Ground versions
	- Relatively fast and small projectile with a slight arc to it
