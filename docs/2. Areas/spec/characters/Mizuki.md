**Mizuki**. In Japanese the word _mizu_ means “felicitous omen, auspicious” and the word ki means “hope,” forming this very cool and beautiful girls’ name.

# Lore
She is a young but competent Asian American fighter. She's a rookie in [[W.A.G.]] and thus often agrees to do stuff that she really shouldn't

# Motifs
- Dual origin between her Asian heritage and American environment
	- Her parents are never mentioned in any more specificity and they are just "Asian"
- Asian side
	- Visual indicators of everything Asian, especially samurai stuff
		- Samurai outfit
		- [[#Kunai]]s
	- Effectiveness through effort and practice
		- [[#Sharpness]] mechanic
- American side
	- Individualism and freedom
		- Her samurai gimmick comes in part from [[W.A.G.]], she is clearly rebelling against it
		- Her own touches around her outfit
		- [[#Place in the roster]] indicates she's "the Ryu", but she has a very non-Ryu kit
	- Millennial economy
		- A lot of her staple items are consumable
		- Her permanent upgrades are comparatively expensive
	- Occasionally brash
		- [[#Back step]] works by making you taunt her
		- Can bite her in the ass and be a bit cocky

# Place in the roster
- She will be the anchor in terms of balance.
	- All other characters ought to be balanced around her 
- Strengths
	- Hard reads => hit hard
	- Can grind meter with [[Link bonus]] on [[#Sharpen]]
	- She's good at making you play her game
		- If you spam projectiles full screen because that gives her time to [[#Sharpen]]
		- If you approach, you'll have to play the close range game with high stakes
- Weaknesses
	- Effectiveness depends on [[#Sharpness]] stacks
	- No natural projectiles, [[#Kunai]] gets expensive to spam
	- Meh pokes

# Mechanics
## Sharpness
- Stacks up to 10
- [[#Sharpen]] adds one stack
- Having stacks makes sword moves like [[#Upwards slice]] and some [[#Back step]] follow-ups do
	- More damage on hit and block
	- Less knockback
- Stacks lost (on hit / on block)
	- `f`: Up to 2 / Up to 5
	- `s`: Up to 3 / all

- How is [[Clash parry]] treated with [[#Sharpness]] loss?
