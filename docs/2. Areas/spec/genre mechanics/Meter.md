#todo This is just ported from old and nowhere up to date

- Integer max 3-5 depending on character
  - Maximum should be low and return rate relatively fast
  - You can gain less than 1, but always spent in integers
- Used by Special moves, [[2. Areas/spec/unique mechanics/Items]]s and turned to [[money (old)]] if not used by the end of the round
- Gained for doing 'cool stuff'.
	- Precise inputs
	- Winning neutral
	- This is the primary reward method. Meter costing moves ought to be bonkers.
