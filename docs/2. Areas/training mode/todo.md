Training mode is not in MVP

Call the training mode the lab

Here is a list of things to do when I get to it:
- Tools
	- Rewind time
	- Slow motion to see things
	- Execution bot for perfect execution
- Visual indicators
	- Animation state
	- Blockstun
	- Charge
	- Color change in recovery or similar to indicate if a move is safe, negative or unsafe
		- Negative-unsafe is like a yellow to red spectrum that indicates how punishable it is
	- Damage number popups
 - Combo learning tool that tells you what you fuck up with
	 - Too early or too late
