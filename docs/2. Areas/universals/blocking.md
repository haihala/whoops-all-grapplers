# Blocking
Hold back to block. Every move does lethal chip damage. Blocking height is dynamic. Same attack can be a high for a small character and a mid for big character.

## Parry
Quickly tapping forwards will parry an incoming attacks. Parrying will negate chip and increase pushback.

You can't block immediately after parrying. You can't parry while in block stun.
