# Cancel
## Automatic cancel
Many moves can be canceled automatically.

Dash/jump -> Any normal -> Some normals -> Any special

Some very specific special -> Some equally specific normals

## Manual cancel
The cancel button has multiple effects. All the options cost some [[meter]].

## Instant recovery
2 [[meter]]

`C` to activate. Cancels remaining hitstun, freefall and get up instantly if on the ground. Can't act for the first ten or so frames to make this punishable and baitable. 

It's supposed to be commonly used. Combos would work around juggling for more damage 'mixups'. If you expect the opponent to juggle you high up, you could recover there and block on your way down or attack, but if the opponent is instantly following up with a less damaging but fast attack, you get clapped for even more. 

## Active cancel
1 [[meter]]

`C` pressed during any part of an attack animation to activate. The rest of that animation is cancelled.
