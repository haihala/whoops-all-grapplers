For many players, there are problems with the way combos traditionally work

Problems:
1. Getting comboed makes you feel helpless
2. Non-interactive
3. Comboing someone feels like a memory pop quiz
4. Dropping feels bad for the attacker, but defender doesn't feel anything
5. "Learning combos is boring"
6. Results seem small beyond the basics

We'll get back to these in a while

# Traditional combo structure benefits
Many games, especially anime fighters have a very linear combo structure:
- Initial hit -> 
- (cancel chain ->) 
- launcher -> 
- cancel chain -> 
- (jump cancel -> cancel chain ->) 
- finisher

Benefits:
- You can make associations
	- Launch = High damage
- Less about memorization, more about finding initial hits that lead into launchers 
- It's visually interesting
- Allows the game to add moves that don't combo into launchers
	- They have more room in the power budget for interesting stuff
- Switching characters is easier

# Theory: Many of the aformentioned are a result of removing target's agency
Assertions:
1. People often don't like touch of death games
2. Landing multiple hits feels good
3. Hard cap on combo damage feels bad
4. Difficulty measures player ability
5. Player ability is finite
6. Memorization is difficulty
7. Execution is difficulty
8. Memorization is preferable to execution
	1. This is probably the most questionable one
	2. Failing memorization feels less bad than failing at execution
	3. Succeeding at execution feels better than succeeding at memorization
	4. Assuming that has to do with expectations
		1. We expect to do something we know how to technically do
		2. Failing memorization is usually about not knowing the answer, which is to be expected.
	5. Negativity bias
9. Route knowledge requires more memorization
10. Players engage with difficulty
11. Players like to engage with the game
12. Longer combos test route knowledge
13. Purpose of a game is for players to like it
14. Long combos take a long time
15. Not all players engage with the same kind of difficulty
16. When players don't like something, they compare it to something else they don't like that is vaguely similar.
17. Pop quizzes test memorization
18. Player ability is not constant
19. Failing feels bad
20. Fighting games cause roughly mirrored feelings
21. Negativity bias
22. Difficulty requires effort
23. Unengaging effort is boring
24. Player ability follows the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

Logic:
1. A1 => killing off of a single hit needs to be nontrivial
2. A2 => target must get hit multiple times
3. L2 => target can't stop getting hit multiple times
4. L1+L3 =>  must limit combo damage, but not involve interaction from target
5. L4+A3 => combo damage must depend on attacking player
6. L5+A4 => combo damage must be be a function of difficulty of that combo
7. A5+A6+A7 => there must be a balance between execution and memorization
8. L7+A8 => Memory should be favored over execution
9. L8+A9 => Route knowledge should be favored over execution
10. L6+A10 => Doing difficult combos is engaging
11. L10+A11 => Players like doing difficult combos
12. L9+L11 => Players prefer combos with route knowledge over execution
13. L12+A12 => Players prefer longer combos over execution
14. L13+A13 => Put long combos in the game

Consequences:
1. L3+L14+A14 => The target will spend a lot of time helplessly getting comboed
3. C1 => Target will feel helpless = P1
4. L3 => Target can't interact with the combo = P2
6. A5+A6+A15 => Not all players engage with memorization
7. C5+L14 => Not all players like long combos
8. C6+A16+A17 => Some players will compare long combos to pop quizzes = P3
9. A4+A5+A18 => Sometimes a player will fail
10. C9+A19 => Sometimes the player will feel bad
11. C10+A20 => Sometimes a player feels good for the other player's failure
12. C11+A21 => The sum total in these cases is usually a bit negative 
13. C12+L5 => Dropping a combo feels worse than it feels good for the target = P4
14. L14+A22 => Learning long combos requires effort
15. C14+A15+A23 => Some players will find learning combos boring = P5
16. C14+A24 => Learning slows down over time = P6

# Hypothesis: Giving the defendant active options makes combos more dynamic
## Directional influence
Like in smash, if the defender can have some influence on how knockback affects their character. You can't control the distance, but you can control the angle. Leads to guessing for the attacker.

Maybe limit how often you can do it so it can be more influential.
- [[meter]] cost
- Every third hit or something like that.

## Instant recovery
See [[cancel#Instant recovery]].

# Hypothesis 2: Combo scaling is a relic
Instead of your hits dealing less damage, the longer a combo goes on, add a bonus for the first hit and then keep the damage standard. 

Benefits:
- There is never a case where adding a hit reduces total damage
- Easy to understand
- Can condition players with the combo starter fx
- Getting reset wouldn't suck as badly.
- Baiting for [[cancel#Instant recovery]] would yield tangible benefits

The last two may seem contradictory, but I'd argue that the primal satisfaction of fx is greater than knowing that you will deal an ambiguous amount more damage.

Cons:
- Wider skill gap
	- Not inherently bad in the end, but does make matchmaking difficult
- Infinites are a game ender
	- They already were, but now they take less time and must be patched out instead of tolerated because 'execution difficulty' or some such bullshit.
