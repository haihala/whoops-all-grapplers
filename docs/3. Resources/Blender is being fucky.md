This is a document for when blender is being fucky

# Exported GLTF
## Contains extra models
- Select what you want to export before exporting
- Limit export to selected only

## Model is invisible in bevy
- Did you select the armature **and** the mesh before exporting

## Rotates / scales / some other bullshit on export
- There is probably an extra animation generated from adding a new thing
- Delete that action, retry.

# Animations
## Bend adjacent body parts but not the ones bones are inside of
- Inverted normals
