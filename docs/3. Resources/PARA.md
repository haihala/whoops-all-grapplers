A way to organize work.

[Explanatory blog post](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/)

1. Projects - Tasks to complete
2. Areas - Standard to maintain
3. Resources - External guidance
4. Archive - Things from the other 3 that are no longer relevant
	1. May be relevant later, so don't delete, archive.
	2. At the beginning when you make a lot of fluff with zero value, it's ok to delete

Projects should always belong to areas. This is somewhat flexible, as the project may create it's own area.

Main difference between projects and areas is the difference of finite and infinite games in game theory. A project must have an end in mind, whereas an area cannot have one. See Simon Sinek.

There should never be more than 5 projects, 5 is questionable.
