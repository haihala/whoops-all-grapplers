A way to organize work.

# In principle
[Explanatory blog post](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/)

1. Projects - Tasks to complete
2. Areas - Standard to maintain
3. Resources - External guidance
4. Archive - Things from the other 3 that are no longer relevant
	1. Everything may be relevant later, never delete, move to archive.

Projects should always belong to areas. This is somewhat flexible, as the project may create it's own area.

Main difference between projects and areas is the difference of finite and infinite games in game theory. A project must have an end in mind, whereas an area cannot have one. See Simon Sinek.

There should never be more than 5 projects, 5 is questionable.

# In practice
Projects contain all the tasks that need doing, compareable to a backlog in a traditional kanban like system. This may or may not be optimal, but for one dev it's nice to keep the code, docs, [[Scratchpad]] for loose ideas, individual tasks and task trackers in the repo. 

Considering https://shortcut.com/ for the second dev depending on activity.
