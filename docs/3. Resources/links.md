[Shortcut](https://app.shortcut.com/bathrobe)

Shortcut and the projects section overlap, but serve subtly different purposes. Clubhouse is meant to track the overall work amount, while projects are meant to be more gradual and focused on what is currently happening.

[Taskboard](https://tasksboard.com/app)

Taskboard is a note taking app. Sometimes ideas come up in a situation where properly formulating them into Shortcut isn't feasible and it's useful to have some place to put them.

However the taskboard needs to be cleaned occasionally to be useful. The more time there is between taskboard scrubs, the more daunting it gets.
