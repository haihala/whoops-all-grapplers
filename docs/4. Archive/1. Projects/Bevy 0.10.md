# TODO
- https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/0.9-0.10/#directly-extract-joints-into-skinnedmeshjoints
- https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/0.9-0.10/#rename-tick-is-older-than-to-tick-is-newer-than
- Pad updating could maybe find relevant pad dynamically instead of looping through all of them
- https://github.com/jakobhellermann/bevy_mod_debugdump seemed like it could be useful for drawing graphs.
- Fix recursive reflection problem to show player state in the inspector again
