Usually in wrestling people get to do their shit and counters aren't emphasized

Maybe add a toast 'trapped' for situations where a player gets counterhit by a slower move. 

Maybe add 'hard trapped' for situations where they get counterhit and none of their moves would've been fast enough to stuff it.

A third one 'stuffed' that indicates a move was interrupted by another.

Characters should say the toasts out loud
