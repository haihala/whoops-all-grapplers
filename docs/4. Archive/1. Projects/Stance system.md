#blocked by [[Move phase format rework]]

- Have a stance enum similar to MoveId
	- Add a set of active stances to situation
	- Add helpers to `PlayerState` to get the active stances
- Some moves require a stance to start up
- Some stances [[Gi of the old masters]] for example do stuff outside move progression
