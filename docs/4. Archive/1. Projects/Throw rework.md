Problems:

- Weird offset
- Knockback on back throws
- Random sideswitches

Solutions:

- Dedicated throw state
    - Will block most things from happening, things that could cancel the animation
- Fix recalculating position afterwards
- Fix snapping behavior
- Add a crouching throw to scoop crouchers
    - Less reward than a standing throw, but easier to hit
