# Lex
- Cocky shoto girl, foil to [[Ryan]]
- Name references both Alex (third strike next gen protagonist) and AOC (goat)
	- Obviously three letters because shoto
- Peekoo voice?

## Writeup
- The aim is to make a reckless character so that the player feels like they ought to be a gorilla.
- She has:
	- A lot of unsafe shit she has to cancel into unsafe shit.
	- Bad pokes
	- Fuckload of damage
	- Armor moves

## Mechanics
### Heat
- Two levels
	- Level 0: Nothing
	- Level 1: Hands on fire
	- Level 2: Hair also on fire
- Getting a hit in bumps you up by a level
- Not swinging or whiffing for a while drops you down
- Heat will make her moves just straight up busted, but she has to keep swinging

## Moves
All specials force not blocking aka have forward inputs and no back inputs

### Fireball
- Forward quarter + `f` / `s` / `fs`
- Lobbing a fire blast towards the enemy
	- Big area
	- Short range
	- Damage fall off the further you are
	- Air version
		- Is diagonal
		- Goes for a shorter distance horizontally
		- Moves her back a bit, similar to Baiken j.D
- `f` - Weaker, free version
- `s` - Drops her down by one level of [[#Heat]]
- `fs` - Uses meter instead of [[#Heat]], attribute wise similar to `s` version

### Overhead
- Upside down forward quarter + `f` / `s` / `fs` (Ground only)
- Ground only
- Needs an item
- Has armor until recovery starts
- Very fast overhead strike
- `f` - Keeps Lex grounded
- `s` - Leaves Lex slightly airborne for a double overhead
- `fs` - Lunges forwards beforehand

### "Tried to do an [[#Overhead]] but jumped accidentally"
- Upside down forward quarter + `f` / `s` / `fs` (Air only)
- Similar to bandit bringer
- `f` - Leaves Lex slightly airborne for a double overhead
- `s` - Slightly slower, but she lands immediately afterwards
- `fs` - Noticably slower, but she is + afterwards

### Kickflip
- Reverse upside down forward quarter + `f` / `s` / `fs`
- DP. Air ok.
- Moves her up and forward
	- Less movement than [[#Boost]]
	- Primary point is the up forward facing hitbox (anti-air)
- Ground version is actually only slightly punishable
- Has armor until recovery starts
- Air version is very punishable
	- Accidental jumps are a bitch
- Animation similar to Flash kick
- `f` - More upwards movement
- `s` - More forward movement
- `fs` - Lex does a second kick with a bit of a delay

### Boost
- Reverse upside down forward quarter + `f` / `s` / `fs`
- Lex releases a blast of fire, boosting her upwards and forwards
	- Way more movement than [[#Kickflip]]
	- Primary point is the movement
- Blast can do damage and cross up
- `f` - More upwards movement
- `s` - More forward movement
- `fs` - Two fireblasts angled similarly to `s` version

## Visuals
- Kagetsu vibes
- A punk

## Audio
- Every blocked hit will make a match scratching sound
- Every hit will add a roaring ignition

## Flair
- Cocky, brash
- A lot of Baiken, some Mika, some Juri, a smidge of Sayan
