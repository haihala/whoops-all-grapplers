# Ryan
The entry point. An old grizzled veteran.

## Writeup
Ryan is a 50-something year old half asian half white dude who has been "doing this for a while". He is an obvious "Loganification" of Ryu.

## Mechanics
### Frail
- Hitting an opponent (more on block) will make [[Ryan]] go frail
- Each hit does less damage than the previous one
- Lasts over the rounds

## Items
Drugs 
- Buying them removes the downsides of [[#Frail]] and even gets you above the baseline
- Each time you buy, the price goes up a bit
	- Starts at a no-brainer low cost
- Not buying them will lead into withdrawal, which makes him a bit slower

## Moves
### Jab
- `f`
- Quick jab

### Sweep
### Backhand
- Back + `f`
- Similar to Guile's Spinning Back Knuckle

### Parry/super block/?
- `h`
- This has to do *something*

### Hail mary
- Forwards + `h`
- Lunges forwards, somewhat similarly to fafnir
- Can be used mid dash for easy kara like cancel

### Dragon counter
- Dragon punch motion + `h`
- Shoryuken that is also a counter, doesn't go off unless hit during startup
- Pulls the opponent across and launches them in the air

### Fireball
- Quarter Circle Forward + `h`
- Quick and small fireball that goes about half screen or less
- Looks wimpy but can be cancelled into stuff

## Visuals
Salt and pepper (emphasis on the salt) hair and bear, fit for his age, but covered in scars, Dresses simple due to clothes not lasting long in his profession.

## Audio
Juicy, crunchy and gravely

## Flair
Mechanically, the character is a brick. Solid, simple and never fails, but can be used in a variety of ways. A large part of why someone would stick with Ryan is how solid he is. He is an all-rounder who has some unique tricks of his own.

Audiovisually, he has a lot of what makes old man logan interesting.
