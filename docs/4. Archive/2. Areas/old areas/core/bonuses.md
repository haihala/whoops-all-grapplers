# Opener
Instead of combo scaling, the initial hit gets a damage buff (2x damage).

# Timing
If a button is timed instead of spammed, the player gets the timing bonus, which gives some [[Meter]]. 

# What to reward
Events that can happen in a fighting game:
- Walking
	- Back
	- Forward
- Dashing
	- Back
	- Forward
- Jumping
- Attacking
	- Whiffing
	- Landing
	- Getting blocked
	- Counter hit
- Throwing
- Throw teching
- Cancel
	- Jump cancel
	- Dash cancel
	- Normal cancel
	- Special cancel

Situations the player can be in / behavior the player can exhibit in a fighting game:
- Neutral
- Comboing
- Getting comboed
- Mashing buttons
- Timing buttons
- Zoning
- Rushdown
- Rock paper scissors
	- Oki

Reward the behavior you want in the situations you think are interesting. Reward over penalty. Also don't reward rewards. There is no point in giving meter based on combo damage, at least directly. Rewards should try to influence gameplay based on the preferred behavior.

It's meant to be a fake hype show, so reward hype shit.

Ideas:
- Reward not mashing out combos
	- Detect mashing by seeing if events expire
- Parrying
- New moves in a combo
	- Long non-repetetive comboes
- Good neutral
	- More hit stun on the first hit
	- More damage on the second hit (conversions)
	- Heighten the tension by increasing the aformentioned as time goes on.
		- Slowly build up 'tension' and when someone lands a hit they gain a lot of meter if it has been a while since the last clean hit.

# What no to do
## V-trigger and v-bar in SFV
- A new player feels like they always die after using it so what's the point
- It's almost guaranteed to happen every round, making it somewhat samey
- It's very strong, making comebacks too likely
- v-bar does nothing unless you get a full bar, meaning most things that give you v-bar are pointless as they don't give you enough for a full bar with a single use.
