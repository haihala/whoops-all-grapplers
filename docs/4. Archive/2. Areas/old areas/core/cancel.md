# Cancel
## Free cancel
Many moves can be canceled automatically. See `moves/lib.rs:CancelLevel` for specifics, but in general every action is on a linear track and you can cancel stuff that has a lower cancel level with stuff that has a higher cancel level.

## Cancel items
Some [[Items]]s allow for cancels. Guilty Gear RC and Burst.
