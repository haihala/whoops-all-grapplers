# Movement
## Walking
Players move at a constant pace on the ground.

## Jump
Neutral and diagonal. Normal and superjumps (tap down before jumping for more jump power).

## Ground dash
A dash is a commital movement option on the ground. Useful for a fast approach.

Consists of two parts, the latter of which can be cancelled into jumps for super fast diagonal air approaches or with a move for a sliding move. The only things you really can't do from dash recovery is walk or block.

## Air dash
Requires an [[2. Areas/spec/unique mechanics/Items]]. Combined with the double jump [[2. Areas/spec/unique mechanics/Items]] for a downwards air dash [[2. Areas/spec/unique mechanics/Items]]
