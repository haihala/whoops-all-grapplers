# Community
Everything here should stay as is for a while. Not because it's not important, but because it is only relevant once the base game works.

## Discord
There needs to be a hub where matchmaking can occur and people can talk about stuff.

Todo:
- Emotes for motions (establish names for them)

## Weeklies
Weekly regional tournaments, the winners of which can be shown in the game. Maybe there is a place where you can see who is the previous winner in each region and how long is their win streak. Maybe have the player with the longest streak there as well. 

## Wiki
All the content that is available for learning in game ought to also be available online in the browser.

## Balance change streams
Purge-like go through patch notes. Initially twitch chat may ask stuff. If this goes somewhere condence twitch chat to a few community members. People can then filter their questions through them.
