- Change how move starting works so that the first phase goes through the same system as the other phases
	- This would fix the bug where the first phase hitboxes etc are ignored
	- If it becomes difficult, could add a 1-frame animation as the first phase automatically.
- Add a special case `MoveAction` that has a switch for `MoveId`
	- For [[Gi of the old masters]] parry window opening
	- For entering [[Stance system]]
