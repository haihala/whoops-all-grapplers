# Glossary

To keep a consistent terminology. In the rest of the text, stuff that can be found in this document should be bolded. The explanations aren't really important, the purpose is to determine what words are used for various things.

## Resources

Health - Health of a character. If it gets to 0 you lose.
Zeal - Limited resource for certain actions

## Genre concepts

Stun - A state where a character cannot act
Hitstun - Stun caused by getting struck
Blockstun - Stun caused by blocking, usually shorter than hitstun.
Startup frames - Animation required before a move can affect the opponent
Active frames - The time window where a move can affect the opponent
Recovery frames- Animation after active frames that usually returns your character to the state they were in before the startup frames
Cancel - Interrupting a move before it finishes, usually only the recovery frames can be canceled.
Chip - Damage that gets through blocking
Frame advantage - The difference between recovery frames and block stun caused by a move. If a move inflicts more block stun than it has recovery frames, it has positive frame advantage, if a move recovers for longer than the recipient is in block stun, it has negative frame advantage.
Push back - How far a character is pushed back when they block a strike.
Hitbox - Designated area where a move can deal damage
Hurtbox - Designated area where a character can get hit
