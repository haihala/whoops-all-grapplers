# Design

## Definition of done
Done does not mean finished or immutable.

A character design is done when all of the character's parts are done, see `Characters/index.md`

A systems mechanic is done when:
- It can be explained in three bullets
- It fixes a problem or enhances gameplay
- It doesn't have any obvious problems
- It doesn't clash with player promises

## What goes where

### Design docs root
