# Break
The Break button has multiple effects. All the options cost some **zeal**.

Characters can have their own break effects that may or may not require motion inputs.

## Combo breaker (3 zeal)
5B to activate. Launches an AoE blast around you that if not blocked launches the
opponent far away. Deals no damage and takes a while to recover from.

Somewhat punishable on block, but overall a relatively safe option for making yourself a second to think.

## Instant recovery (1 zeal)
8B while in the air in hitstun to activate. Instantly gets out of hit stun, this is very punishable

## Flash cancel (1 zeal)
6B pressed during any part of an attack animation to activate. The rest of that animation is cancelled.

Possibly minidashes forwards on some characters.

## Limit break (1 zeal)
6B pressed while an attack is not ongoing to activate. Puts your character in the Limit break state.

In Limit break, some of your character's moves gain special properties, but the buff ends the first time you use one of them, get hit, or after five seconds.

## Autoblock (1 zeal)
TODO: How long does autoblock last?
4B will activate autoblock. Will automatically block all strikes for a period of time. Not throw invincible and can be meatied
