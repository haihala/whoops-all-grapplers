Done:
- Shop buys shit from post-round inputs
- Maybe no chip damage on normals
- Flyweight may not be as good as expected
- Thumbtacks to damage multiplier instead of additive
- Round end notifications don't vanish

Undone:
- Undo button in the shop
- Meter gain is pretty high
- Crouching strong is an infinite in the corner
