# Local feedback round

I accidentally goofed and deleted the notes before committing to git. This is
written from memory.

- They seemed to in general like it
  - They got the concept
- Bugs
  - Jumps sometimes went the wrong way
  - Holding up won't jump
  - End screen reset and return to main menu don't work
  - Round reset may fuck up character facing
  - After game over animations keep playing
- Oversights
  - Movement feels a bit hard to control
    - Forward dash in general invalidates the rest of the movement
  - Dash throw is really hard to defend and easy to apply
  - 2f is easily an infinite
    - Hit spark may happen even if you couldn't have blocked
    - Pushback seems to be broken
  - Start is not mentioned in shop tips
- Suggestions
  - Visible move list somewhere
