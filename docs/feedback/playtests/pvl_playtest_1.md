- They got stuck in character select
- New controller was some amount of difficult
- Paper guide did not help with inputs
- A few tech issues
- One player got it
- Few others were pressing buttons
    - Not that fun of a game to just press buttons in
- Falling through the floor is a thing
    - I think the constraint resolution gets blocked for throws
    - Breaks if there is downwards motion.
- Thumbtack MS bug makes it more fun, maybe increase speed overall
- Hand model extends unnaturally, more reason to redo forward walk
