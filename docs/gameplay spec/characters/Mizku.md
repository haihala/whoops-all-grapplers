**Mizuki**. In Japanese the word _mizu_ means “felicitous omen, auspicious” and the word ki means “hope,” forming this very cool and beautiful girls’ name.

Nicknamed Mizku because it sounds like Masku which is funny Tekken meme.
# Lore
She is a young but competent second generation Korean American immigrant. She's a rookie in [[W.A.G.]] and thus often agrees to do stuff that she really shouldn't including her Japanese samurai gimmick. 

# Motifs
- Samurai gimmick
	- Visual indicators
		- Samurai outfit
		- Oni mask
		- [[#Kunai]]s
		- Katana
	- Effectiveness through effort and practice
		- [[#Sharpness]] mechanic
		- Kurosawa-esque staredowns
- Born and raised in the states
	- Millennial economy
		- A lot of her staple items are consumable
		- Her permanent upgrades are comparatively expensive
	- Occasionally brash
		- [[#Sway]] is essentially a taunt
		- **Laid back**, take cues from Baiken in animations.
		- Can bite her in the ass and be a bit cocky
- Her samurai gimmick comes in part from [[W.A.G.]], she is clearly rebelling against it
- [[#Place in the roster]] indicates she's "the Ryu", but she has a very non-Ryu kit

# Place in the roster
- She will be the anchor in terms of balance.
	- All other characters ought to be balanced around her 
- Strengths
	- Hard reads => hit hard
	- Can grind [[Meter]] with [[#Sharpen]]
	- She's good at making you play her game
		- If you spam projectiles full screen, she has time to [[#Sharpen]]
		- If you approach, you'll have to play the close range game with high stakes
- Weaknesses
	- Effectiveness depends on [[#Sharpness]] stacks
	- No natural projectiles, [[#Kunai]] gets expensive to spam
	- Meh pokes

# Mechanics
- Duck is abnormally low and goes under stuff

## Sharpness
- Stacks up to 10
- [[#Sharpen]] adds one stack
- Having stacks makes sword moves like [[#Rising sun]] do more damage
- Resets between rounds

- Function: Jump-in, pressure, air to air, combo starter

		- Due to the angle, hits rather low -> Easy to anti-air
	- Back leg
		- Can hit cross up similar to Kum j.d

- Keeps you close for oki

#### Crouch throw
- Input: `w` while crouching
- Low hitbox
- Switches sides by swinging the opponent by their feet

#### Air throw
- Input: `w` while in the air
- Visual: Ky flippy air throw

#### High slice
- Input: `g` while standing
- Visual: Nago f.s
- Slow long range, somewhat mediocre stab
- Is a sword move, so it deals good damage, especially with [[#Sharpness]]

#### Low slice
- Input: `g` while crouching
- Visual: Nago 2s
- Slow long range low poke
- Good to cancel to, as it gives you a lot of stun frames

### Specials
#### Sharpen
- Input: `214g` while on the ground
- Visual: In one smooth movement, take the sword out, run it by a whetstone, put it back
- Gain a point of [[#Sharpness]] and a bar of [[Meter]]

#### Rising sun
- Input: `[123][789]` + `f` or `s`
	- You can use it with or without charge
		- Using it without charge will make it drop [[#Sharpness]], 1 for `s`, all for `f`
- Visual: Arching sword swing
- Functions: Anti-air, combo ender, hard read, whiff punish
	- `f` version is less damaging, but free
	- `s` version is more damaging and gains [[Intangible]] on full charge, but costs [[Meter]]
- Air and ground versions
	- Air version exists to lessen the frustration on upwards motions
	- Ground version will recover faster, giving you oki or [[#Sharpen]]
- Death on block and whiff
	- Decent range, not trivial to whiff punish
- Pretty nice chip damage

#### Sway
- Input: `214` + `f` or `s`
- Visual: Dandy step
- Function: Lots
	- Bait whiffs
	- Extend combos
	- Mix up the opponent
	- Apply pressure on wakeup
	- Cancel long recovery of normals
- Steps
	- Start
		- Swing back and crouch down a bit
	- Dash
		- Press the button that didn't start the back sway to dash forward
			- `f` if you started with `214s` and vice versa
		- Can delay the dash or dash immediately
			- This will change the position one ends up
	- Cancel
		- Press G to cancel
		- Cancel into a short animation that returns to neutral
	- Strike
		- 2W - low slide
		- 6W - Overhead
		- 5W - Pilebunker
- If you use the enhanced version, you get:
	- Longer and faster back movement
	- Longer and faster forward dash
	- G - Cancel works after forward dash

Item ideas:
- Jump cancellability
- Re-dash - Lets you cancel either version before an ender to enhanced back sway
- Just frame timings like SFV Karen Tenko
- Make cancel stop momentum

# Items
- [[Kunai]]
- [[Gentleman's pipe]]
- [[Space suit boots]]

# Item ideas
## Blade oil
- Consumable
- Retains [[#Sharpness]] from the previous round

## Bladesmith coupon
- Consumable
- Add [[#Sharpness]] on round start

## Dancing shoes
- Upgrade from [[Boots]]
- Add a follow up to [[#Sway]], where you can cancel into the other version of [[#Sway]]
- This is the fastest way to move back if done optimally
	- How the variants have different animation lengths, that's not trivial

# Moves from [[#Items]]
## Kunai throw
- Input: `236g`
- Visual: Ibuki kunai throw in SFV
- Function: Projectile
	- Relatively fast and small projectile with a slight arc to it
	- Consumes a [[#Kunai]] on use, can't use if you have none
- Maybe add an air version later?
