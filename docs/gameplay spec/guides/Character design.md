# Character
- Personality
	- Desires
	- Methods
- Place in the roster
	- Every character needs to justify their existence
- Treat every character knowing it will be someone's favourite.

# Kit
See [[Tool design]]

## Moves
A character has [[#Normals]] and [[#Specials]]. By default, the character should have the following:
- A [[Gimmick]] that happens when they are on the ground
	- Maybe an air one
- Air, stand, crouch for all other [[Inputs]]
- At least two [[#Specials]]
- No glaring weaknesses they can't cope with

### Normals
Normals are the bedrock of a character. They are what allows you to have wildly different characters that all have tools to deal with various situations

What a player wants from their normals, sorted in rough order of importance:
- Check tool ([[Clash parry]] trigger)
- Throw
- Low
- Anti-air
- Poke = Relatively fast, longer range, generally safe
- Jump-in
- Combo starter / Damage
- Pressure starter (+ on block)
- Knockdown
- Air to air
- Mobility
- Overhead (grounded)
- Jump arc alterer
	- Divekicks etc that make it harder to anti-air you
	- Could have a normal, but likely this one is down to the specials

See [[Inputs]] for how those usually correspond to buttons.

A good normal either
- Does 2 things well
	- Low poke
	- Stagger jab (Check tool + pressure starter)
- Does one thing exceptionally
	- Ultimate punisher = Tool that leads to mad damage combos, but is death on block, has crap range, hits mid, and starts up slowly

### Specials
Specials are the big moves of a character. The ones that make them unique. Characters with the same normals can be wildly different with different specials.

What a player wants from their specials:
- Same stuff as their specials, but **more**
- Projectile (Something that stays on the screen while their character can move)
- Status conditions (both sides)
- Movement (both sides)
- Combo ender
- Combo extender

A good special move:
- Serves a unique niche for the character
	- Is something they would use over other tools
	- Is not ubiquitously the optimal choice in all situations or even in that many situations
- Tells the player something about what the character values
	- Non-confrontational character may prefer moves that keep away for example
- Has an input that makes sense for the motion
- Is interesting
- Can be used in a multitude of ways

## Items
Items can enhance a character. See [[Item design]] for general advice. In addition to general advice, a character's items should tell you something about what that character values / owns.

For example, if designing Ryu from Street fighter, he values:
- Training
- Dedication
- Tradition
- Fighting strong opponents
- Travelling the world

He doesn't care for material belongings that much.

Item ideas for Ryu (categorized as reusable bits of logic):
- Food they likely eat or drink a lot (like?)
	- Stale bread
	- A gourd of water (with no ice)
- Something they likely would have
	- Rucksack (like the one in 3S)
	- Tattered Gi
	- One-way plane ticket
- Something surprising that reveals something non-obvious
	- Herby incense - Hinting at his spiritualism
	- Art of war by Sun Tzu - The battle is in the mind

The functions of the items only need to be vaguely related to the item names.

Mechanically, the items should:
- Give the character something they actually want
- Feel like they are optional
