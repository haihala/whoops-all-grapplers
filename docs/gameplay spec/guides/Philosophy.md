## Audience
The game will be a competetive fighting game *mainly* for people who aren't necessarily fighting game players, but are competetive gamers from other games like CS:GO or LOL.

There will be people who are fighting gamers, but they will be fine with anything as long as the first group is fine with it, and so while they aren't necessarily secondary, their needs are a subset of the first group's needs

There will be people who don't have experience with competitive games, they are free to learn with the resources provided, but the game will not provide them a story mode or an arcade mode or fishing minigames or anything to keep the circusgoers entertained. That shit costs dev time and does not support the core.

### Player promises
1. Game will reward good decision making
2. A new fighting game player will be able to come up and execute on a gameplan consistently
3. Game will be visually clear
4. Solving genre problems
	1. The player absolutely must understand why they lost
	2. Good execution is not mandatory

## Zen
This is mostly so I can laugh at how wrong I got them later.

1. Reward don't require
2. Net positive fun
	1. Dropping a combo is sad for attacker, neutral for defender, net negative
3. No problem is without a tool and no tools without a problem
	1. Tool just needs to exist, the player doesn't need to have it ([[Items]])
4. Decision making over execution
5. Go deep before going wide
	1. When adding ideas, prefer characters over universals (complex characters over many universals)
6. Seeing the mechanic explains the mechanic
7. Mental load is a cost
8. The obvious answer should be the best answer
	1. If you can tech throws, it should usually be the best way to avoid them
9. The fewer special cases the better
10. If a cool underused mechanic can get highlighted easily, it should be
11.  If something conflicts with the rest of the zen and is explained with convention, it needs to go or be reconstructed,


## Reward vs Requirement
Players have a default answer. Doing nothing, blocking, whatever it may be. If the default option is very bad for them in a situation, they need to do or know something. This is a requirement. If the default is only slightly negative or neutral, but they can do something to make it better, they perceive it as a reward.

Players like getting rewards and too many requirements is off-putting.

Baiting a burst in Strive is rewarding. If bomber loops were a core part of Axl that would be a requirement.

## What makes WAG special
- The items system
- Range of character power. The progression for SF2 to Marvel 2
