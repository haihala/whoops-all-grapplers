## Combo scaling
Upsides:
- It emphasizes shorter combos
- It reduces touch of deaths

Downsides:
- Difficult to really understand and math about
- Not really visible

Workaround:
- [Opener](/docs/gameplay_spec/unique_mechanics/opener.md), a bonus on first hit rather than a penalty on subsequent ones
	- Think of the World of Warcraft well rested case

## Running / walking split
Upsides:
- Go fast

Downsides:
- You rarely want to go slow, so you just have to jump through extra hoops.

Workaround:
- Only one state, animation depends on character

## Counter hits
Upsides:
- Encourages use of smaller moves
- Rewards knowing your character and the matchup

Downsides:
- Rich get richer
- Often happen by accident
- Sometimes hard to react to and you feel stupid for not reacting to them

Workaround:
- Try to go without. If it looks like the game could benefit from counter hits, reconsider
	- If it turns out that those would be nice, add [Items](/docs/gameplay_spec/unique_mechanics/items.md)

## Hard and soft knockdown
Upsides:
- Balance levers
- Differences in kind

Downsides:
- Complexity with little gain
- Confusing for new players

Workaround:
- Just don't
