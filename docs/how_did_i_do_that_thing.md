This is for storing things I may want to know how to redo.

# Audio

- Remember to scrub background noise
- Get like 3-10 takes so there is some variation

## "Female" voice acting

- Try to not sound too manly
- Pitch shift up by 10-30% in audacity
  - Sometimes this gives a robotic sound, in which case just turn up the speed with the pitch
