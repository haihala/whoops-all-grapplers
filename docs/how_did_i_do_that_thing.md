This is for storing things I may want to know how to redo.

## Audio

- Remember to scrub background noise
- Get like 3-10 takes so there is some variation

### "Female" voice acting

- Try to not sound too manly
- Pitch shift up by 10-30% in audacity
  - Sometimes this gives a robotic sound, in which case just turn up the speed with the pitch

## Blender

### Adding bones to the rig generated by rigify

Anything added to the generated rig will get nuked when a new one is generated,
so you gotta add new bones to the metarig that will then be used to generate the
posing rig let's call it.

Procedure:

1. Select metarig in object mode
2. Go to edit mode
3. Add the bones you want\*
4. Go to pose mode (with meta rig still selected
5. Open bone properties (not armature properties)
6. Scroll to the bottom of bone properties to find the rigify settings
7. For each of the added bones
   1. Select that bone
   2. Set the "rig type" to "basic.super_copy"
   3. Set the options to EITHER deform or control (can't be both)
      1. This may require going back to step 3

### Fixing clothes clipping

This can be fixed by copying the weights instead of generating automatic ones.

Procedure:

1. Select the base mesh in object mode
2. Also select the clothing that is clipping (shift-click in view port,
   control-click in hierarchy)
3. Go to weight paint mode (cloth should be mostly blue)
4. In the second top bar (mode specific) settings, go weights > transfer weights
5. In the dialog that pops up, for "source layer se...", (maybe selection?),
   select "by name".
6. Click the pop-up away

The weight paint from the base mesh should now be copied over to the other mesh.
Identical weight paint -> identical movements -> no clipping

If that didn't work, check that modifiers are in the correct order.

### Shake

- Add key frames
- Go to graph editor
- Per channel you want to shake:
  - Select the channel (name turns yellow, NOT check box)
  - On the right (press n if no panel) select "modifier"
  - Add a noise modifier
  - Bigger scale, slower change, 4 is a good default
  - Strength is amplitude, 0.1 is a good default
  - Offset them or they are in sync
- You can copy-paste the modifiers, although clunkily

## Swap colors for p2

- Set a name for the **MESH** of each part of the model in blender
  - Not just the objects
- Map those to colors in the character spec
