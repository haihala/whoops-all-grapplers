# Traits
- Character who gets that good damage only from anti-airs (tip of anti-air has special props?) and then plays an oppressive death by a thousand cuts ground game
- Robot character that heavily uses weird quirks of computer naming in their items (like how HandL sounds like handle)
- Bad boy sumo guy
- Kaizen (continuous improvement in japanese) as the name of a character
- Zoner that gives you a damage buff that gets reset on whiff and when getting hit
- Mantain - Man-mountain
- Some big character has a parry in place of a backdash
- An arsenal character that can do a slow reload animation after shooting or just drop the gun. Dropped guns remain in the world.
- Character who can give special health regen to the opponent
	- Maybe make them a grappler and they can take the special health away on a grab
	- If full, special health starts replacing normal health (slowly)
