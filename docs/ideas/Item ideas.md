# Vague
- Item that is only purchasable if your character has a low winrate globally.
- Employee handbook that grants some basic ability to newbies that most characters start with.
- Shoe lube - Walk immediately accelerates to max speed and holds that while doing other actions for about half a second (microwalks gain a lot of distance)
- Bootleg functions series
	- Item names are scuffed marvel characters like "Magnet man" for magneto
	- They grant a move / trait that is commonly associated with that character in mvc
	- For example: Magnet man would grant an 8-way airdash
- Monkey picture - Does nothing but take up a slot and fluctuate in price (trending downwards, but can occasionally be sold for profit)

# Specific
- Item that lets you do a traditional throw tech
- Shield + Feather => Feathered shield 
	- Lets you air-block one hit
	- It shouldn't be that great. Reference the shield from Bloodborne
- [[Boots]] upgrades
	- There are many and you are somewhat losing value for buying multiple
	- +Shield = Escape plan
		- Invincible backdash
		- Not thrilled about using the shield for this, as it's less blocking and more evading
- 2x Defence item = Hardhat
	- Less damage from overheads

## If the right character comes along
- Jumper cables. Allows you to do electrics with special moves with frame perfect inputs
- Burst that throws a bag of money at the enemy
	- Bag can miss
	- Opponent may collect the bag
