- Bootleg functions series
	- Item names are scuffed marvel characters like "Magnet man" for magneto
	- They grant a move / trait that is commonly associated with that character in mvc

	- Chickens produce an egg per round
	- You can sell the eggs

	- Defense bonus
	- Add a page for defense bonus
	- Simplify defense bonus to contant
- Shield + Feather => Feathered shield 
	- Lets you air-block one hit
	- It shouldn't be that great. Reference the shield from Bloodborne

	- +Shield = Escape plan
		- Invincible backdash
		- Not thrilled about using the shield for this, as it's less blocking and more evading
