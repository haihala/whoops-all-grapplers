- Soul assumption like move that deals damage based on damage taken recently
	- Counts damage taken by both players
	- Pair it with a move that works like oracle heal
- Burst that is faster / larger the longer the combo
- Move where you repeatedly do qcb+button to gain stocks. Use stocks for a big punch (can cancel into punch from wind-ups, better if you do)
- 5653 motion for a sliding dash
- Axe kick that hits mid going up. If it does the attack ends. Hard hitting overhead when coming down. Works as an anti-air when it hits at the apex
- Dash move with a wind-up. You can hold the wind-up for more distance. Has two variants. One is a shorter dash followed by a forward slash, the other is basically alpha blade.
	- Think chainsaw man katana man
- A dash punch that has a charged and an uncharged version, but the uncharged version is better.
	- You can't do the uncharged one out of block unless you get tricky
