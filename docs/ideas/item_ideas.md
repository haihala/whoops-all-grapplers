# Item ideas

This document is a way to store ideas of items

## Aesthetic

- Armor of the Modern Crusader (AMC), a suit item
- Bootleg functions series
  - Item names are scuffed marvel characters like "Magnet man" for magneto
  - They grant a move / trait that is commonly associated with that character in mvc
  - For example: Magnet man would grant an 8-way airdash

## Mechanic

- Traditional throw tech
- Replace your block with a parry
- Quest items
  - Items that give you something cool if you complete a quest
  - Like Hearthstone
- -1 hitstun frame per hit of combo
- Dash self cancel
- Jump cancel on normals
- Helmet that works like raindrop from Dota (this is probably a bad idea)
- Glue that reduces pushback
- Wings that reset air actions when a move makes contact

## Aesthetic + Mechanic

- Some phone charger item that increases charge speed
- Brick
  - Defense bonus
  - Add a page for defense bonus
  - Simplify defense bonus to contant
- Shield + Feather => Feathered shield
  - Lets you air-block one hit
  - It shouldn't be that great. Reference the shield from Bloodborne
- [Boots](/docs/gameplay_spec/items/boots.md) upgrades
  - There are many and you are somewhat losing value for buying multiple
  - +Shield = Escape plan
    - Invincible backdash
    - Not thrilled about using the shield for this, as it's less blocking and more evading
- 2x Defence item = Hardhat
  - Less damage from overheads
- Jumper cables. Allows you to do electrics with special moves with frame perfect inputs
- Burst that throws a bag of money at the enemy
  - Bag can miss
  - Opponent may collect the bag
