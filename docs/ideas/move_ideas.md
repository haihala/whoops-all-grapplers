- Soul assumption like move that deals damage based on damage taken recently
  - Counts damage taken by both players
  - Pair it with a move that works like oracle heal
- Burst that is faster / larger the longer the combo
- Move where you repeatedly do qcb+button to gain stocks. Use stocks for a big punch (can cancel into punch from wind-ups, better if you do)
- 5653 motion for a sliding dash
- Axe kick that hits mid going up. If it does the attack ends. Hard hitting overhead when coming down. Works as an anti-air when it hits at the apex
- Dash move with a wind-up. You can hold the wind-up for more distance. Has two variants. One is a shorter dash followed by a forward slash, the other is basically alpha blade.
  - Think chainsaw man katana man
- A dash punch that has a charged and an uncharged version, but the uncharged version is better.
  - You can't do the uncharged one out of block unless you get tricky
- A move called "con", which puts the player in a rekka-like state they can continue with extentions like "-centrate", "-test", "-vince"
- qcf+f small hop forwards
  - -> f for fast anti-air
  - -> 46+button for a donkey kick (with lightning bolt effect)
  - -> g for a grab face, connect with knees, fall on your back
- Forward charge, back+button = counter
- Whip attacks with slightly adjustable sweet spots
  - Like doing qcf+f will put the origin at a point and then the stick position slightly moves where the hit is
- 693 as an overhead input (heavy smash)
- 689 input shoryuken that has a 623 downwards smash follow up
- `[3]6`, A super fast dash straight and `[47]3` dash low on the same character.
  - Upgrade item to combine the charges.
- 360 inputs where the direction matters (clockwise is different from counter clockwise)
- Command grab input chopped up (first do half circle to enter a stance, then up+button
