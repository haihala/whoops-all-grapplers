Hulk Hogan, Escanor, Potemkin, Zangief, the dude from the Wrestler.

- Escanor looking motherfucker
	- **The** big guy
- Old grizzled veteran
	- What 30 years of wrestling does to a MF
	- The Wrestler movie
	- Needs consumables like painkillers to get back to baseline
		- Doesn't full heal after rounds
		- Damage penalty if an item not used
		- Maybe do some of this but this could also be really unfun and the second item you have to buy for this doesn't really add that much
- Deliberately chooses to not "Cheat".
	- They acknowledge that they would have it easier but choose to do it right
	- Instead they compensate with an insane grindset
