- My take on teaching materials
- Player is dropped into a situation and given a goal to achieve with the current toolset
- Sometimes you have pre-set items
- Sometimes you can buy items with a limited budget
  - All of them are relevant
  - Popup shows them what they have
- Time is stopped until player makes their first move

# Puzzle types

- Each type has three classes
  - Useful - Essentially the tutorial
  - Esoteric - Things that will make you go "huh"
  - Difficult - Hard ones
- Some may change per character

## Survival puzzles

- Goal: Survive until timer runs out
- Opponent will perform one of several variations of a series of events that requires certain decisions to defend against
- Examples of sequences (player starts at low health and can't usually get hit)
  - Series of + on block mids
  - Series of lows
  - Mix of lows and overheads
  - Walk/dash up throws
  - Mix of lows, throws, overheads
  - Flurry of blows (Player has 1hp and [Gi](/docs/gameplay_spec/items/gi.md))

## Lethal puzzles

- Goal: Kill the opponent
- Opponents have
  - Just enough HP that you need to do a good combo to kill
  - A special item that grants them a raid boss enrage once they can act again
- Examples of situations (Variations based on frames and distance)
  - Block punish
  - Whiff punish
  - Abare gap in blockstring

## Mixup puzzles

- Goal: Land a hit
- Bot will do some common turtle tactic
- Goal is to open the bot up
- Examples:
  - Holding down back
  - Holding up back
  - Pre-emptive defence (using longest range attack to stub offense)
- This will teach the players about the neutral triangle explained so well in [neutral.mp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjmnNbG0HAw)
