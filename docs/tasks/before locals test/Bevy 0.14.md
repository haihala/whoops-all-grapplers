Todo:
- Shop item background color no longer needs the wrapper layer
- Typed GLTF labels instead of format string for loading animations

Maybe:
- Consider where the new observer system could be used to clear up stuff
- Switch to the oklab color space
- Consider using the new gpu profiling tools
	- Maybe do some cpu profiling as well
- RenderLayers instead of the kludge show in state thing
