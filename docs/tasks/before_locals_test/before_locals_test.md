Gotta do:

- Quick round over the moves
  - Frame data makes sense (currently hard to combo)
- Update steam deck

If there is time:

- Airdash item
- Item that makes Samurai 2h freeze the enemy momentum
- De-macro dashes to a builder
- Split hitbox attributes to a separate builder, main builder just has a bunch
  of "at frame x do these actions" points and handles requirements
