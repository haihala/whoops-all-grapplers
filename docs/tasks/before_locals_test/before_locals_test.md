- Go through [chore list](/docs/tasks/chore_tracker.md)
- Do some of the input parser rewords (so multipresses can happen)
- Rebalance for a best of five rounds
  - Make sure the players can buy a bunch of stuff round 1
  - Adjust loss penalty built-up
    - First loss is notably less
    - Second loss is basically equal
    - Third loss is slightly more
- Quick round over the items
  - Costs make sense
  - Effects make sense
  - Descriptions still accurate and informative
- Rename "mizku" to "Samurai" etc
- Quick round over the moves
  - Hitboxes are in the right positions
  - Frame data makes sense (currently hard to combo)
  - Sword stance
    - Fast is good as is
      - Could add options (items)
        - 6]x[ for an overhead slam
        - 66 and 44 for teleport dashes
    - Heavy
      - Change slash color
      - Everything is slower and strikes deal more damage
      - Rising sun knocks up higher (combo friendly)
      - Viper strike lunges goes way further
      - Sharpen gives you more meter
    - EX (think of a better word, both buttons + costs meter)
      - Change slash color
      - Invincible and more damaging
        - Vulnerable state
          - Starts after invincibility is over
          - 2x damage multiplier on next hit
          - Broken glass sfx when hit
          - Add a property to some moves that doesn't consume the hit
            - Maybe with items
          - Lasts until recovered from current move
      - Rising sun and viper strike add further invincibility
      - Sharpen gives a second sharpness stack
  - Kunai
    - Allow speed control with forward/back input (item)
    - Add a mechanic to recover lost Kunais (item)
    - Fix problem where they miss up close
    - Add s and EX versions
      - S version goes upwards with slightly less horizontal speed
      - EX version throws two kunais (both F and S versions)
        - Maybe later, for now just make it a super fast one
