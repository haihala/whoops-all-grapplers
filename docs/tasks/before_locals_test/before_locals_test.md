- Go through [chore list](/docs/tasks/chore_tracker.md)
- Quick round over the items
  - Costs make sense
  - Effects make sense
  - Descriptions still accurate and informative
- Quick round over the moves
  - Hitboxes are in the right positions
  - Frame data makes sense (currently hard to combo)
  - Metered sword stance
    - Invincible by default
    - Extra damage vulnerable state
      - 2x damage multiplier on next hit
      - Broken glass sfx when hit
      - Add a property to some moves that doesn't consume the hit
        - Maybe with items
- Make on hit a function callback as well instead of pre-determined lists
  - It takes a situation
  - Also gets a struct that describes the hit (where, was it blocked?)
  - This hopefully fixes particle spawn position for projectiles
