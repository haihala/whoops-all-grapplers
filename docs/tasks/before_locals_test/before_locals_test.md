- Go through [chore list](/docs/tasks/chore_tracker.md)
- Quick round over the items
  - Costs make sense
  - Effects make sense
  - Descriptions still accurate and informative
- Quick round over the moves
  - Hitboxes are in the right positions
  - Frame data makes sense (currently hard to combo)
  - Kunai
    - Allow speed control with forward/back input (item, rocket fins)
    - Add a mechanic to recover lost Kunais
      - (item, boomerang?)
        - On hit?
        - Upgrade that does it on block
        - Later on make them drop to the ground instead of auto-recovering
          - Or at least add an item to do that
      - EX move recovers all Kunais for a bar
