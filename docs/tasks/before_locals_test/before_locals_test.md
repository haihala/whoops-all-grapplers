Gotta do:

- Quick round over the moves
  - Frame data makes sense (currently hard to combo)
  - 2h only first hit should launch
  - Kunai
    - Add a mechanic to recover lost Kunais
      - (item, boomerang?)
        - On hit?
        - Upgrade that does it on block
        - Later on make them drop to the ground instead of auto-recovering
          - Or at least add an item to do that
      - EX move recovers all Kunais for a bar
- Update steam deck

If there is time:

- Airdash item
- Item that makes Samurai 2h freeze the enemy momentum
- De-macro dashes to a builder
- Split hitbox attributes to a separate builder, main builder just has a bunch
  of "at frame x do these actions" points and handles requirements
