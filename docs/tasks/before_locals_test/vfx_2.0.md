- [x] Add
	- [x] Throw tech
	- [x] Throw (sharp lines converging on a point)
	- [ ] Hit spark variations that indicate
        - [ ] First attack only particles
            - [x] Lightning bolt for overheads
            - [x] Spark for mids
            - [ ] Magma burst for lows
        - [ ] Smaller particle for hits in combos

- [ ] Consider removing one level of abstraction and just creating the shader assets live. (this would simplify a few things)
