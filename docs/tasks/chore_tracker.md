# Chore tracker

For little things that don't deserve their own tickets nor are time sensitive
enough to be put on a more important list.

## Bugs

- Online clock is out of sync
- Sometimes shopping does not work (can't buy items)
- Kunais reset to 2 after using one at 8
- You don't need bar for enhanced kunais (doesn't consume either)

### Watchlist

- Attacks sometimes hit more than once
- There is an input recording strangeness, parrots don't always work, probably an ordering question.

## Misc improvement ideas

- Pushback should not apply to projectiles
- Newtype wrapper for frames.
  - Currently using usize, which means frames 99% of the time, but not always.
- Maybe you could make requirements dynamic as well?
