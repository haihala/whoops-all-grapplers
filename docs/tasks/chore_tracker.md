# Chore tracker

For little things that don't deserve their own tickets nor are time sensitive
enough to be put on a more important list.

## Bugs

- Controllers connected after game has started show up weird in the controller claim menu

### Online

- Online clock is out of sync

### Watchlist

- Stick input occasionally gets stuck
- Players falling through the floor

## Misc improvement ideas

- Pushback should not apply to projectiles
- Newtype wrapper for frames.
  - Currently using usize, which means frames 99% of the time, but not always.
- Maybe you could make requirements dynamic as well?
