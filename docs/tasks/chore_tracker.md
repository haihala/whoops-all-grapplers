# Chore tracker

For little things that don't deserve their own tickets nor are time sensitive
enough to be put on a more important list.

## Bugs

- Sometimes holding down and pressing f gives you 5f instead of 2f
- Maybe sword stance follow ups should be a push system (determined in the
  script) to avoid cases where input is sent too early and nothing happens.

### Online

- Online clock is out of sync

### Watchlist

- Attacks sometimes hit more than once
- There is an input recording strangeness, parrots don't always work, probably an ordering question.

## Misc improvement ideas

- Karas on enhanced specials
- Pushback should not apply to projectiles
- Newtype wrapper for frames.
  - Currently using usize, which means frames 99% of the time, but not always.
- Maybe you could make requirements dynamic as well?
