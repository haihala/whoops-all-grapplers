# Main todo

## Next steps

### Adjustments

- Animations
  - Redo the walk animation to look less goofy (knees)
  - Can 2f animation be made slower (to make cancels easier)
- New cancel window opening
  - If cancels still feel off, increase special move buffer time

### Features

- Add a command normal that's like a good cancel cr.mk/p type of thing
  - This is a backup to the 2f animation update
- Kunai drop on hit, last a while on the ground, then despawn
- Air dash item

### Before contacting artists

- Credits to main menu
- Get some free music up in there
- Check for free SFX / VA work

### Netcode debugging

- More synctest
- Add a system that gets you out of a desync without crashing the game
- Fix clock desyncs
