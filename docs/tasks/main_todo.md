# Main todo

## Next steps

### Before contacting artists

- Get some free music up in there
- Check for free SFX / VA work

### Netcode debugging

- More synctest
  - Immediate desync on some starts
    - Seems like a system ordering inconsistency
- Add a system that gets you out of a desync without crashing the game

### Before public playtests

- Character 2
- Tutorial (mostly text)
- Pretty loading screen (Move lists)
- Settings (volume and keybinds)
- [Input parser rework](/docs/tasks/backlog/input_parser_rework.md)
- Pause / Quit while in a match

## Backlog

Low priority do later tasks

- [Emote button](/docs/tasks/backlog/emote_button.md)
- [Rewards 2.0](/docs/tasks/backlog/rewards_2.0.md)
- [Yoink assets](/docs/tasks/backlog/yoink_assets.md)
- [Netplay 2.0](/docs/tasks/backlog/netplay_2.0.md)
- Delay wakeup on knockdown
- [Popups 3.0](/docs/tasks/backlog/popups_3.0.md)

## Overarching plan

- [x] MVP (Not a rushed one, but one that is maintainable)
- [x] Feedback round 1
- [x] Polish
- [x] Test with fgc grinders
- [x] Backburner until DI is done
- [ ] Start building the community
- [ ] Release to early access
- [ ] Adjust based on stranger feedback until I can't afford bread
