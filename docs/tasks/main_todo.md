# Main todo

## Before next playtest (PP)

- Address [locals playtest feedback](/docs/feedback/playtests/first_locals_feedback_round.md)
  - At least the ones I get to
- Update [Samurai docs](/docs/gameplay_spec/characters/samurai.md)

## After next playtest

- Clear taskboard + tasks
- Make a new dev update video / blog post after new voices
- Anti desync
  - More synctest
  - Add a system that gets you out of a desync without crashing the game
