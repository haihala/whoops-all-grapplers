This is the post-university design. The design before this one was more scattered and less focused and more difficult in terms of identity.

# Design
Focus areas:
- Make [[Mizku#Sword stance]] into her primary "thing"
	- This focuses her game plan around the stance
- [[Mizku#Kunai]]s into a secondary thing
- Utilize skills learned from animating
	- Add character to the animations
	- Make them more snappy
		- Less key frames
			- More defined key poses
			- Don't care if something clips a little
		- Don't start in a neutral pose that feels sluggish
	- Highlight that she actually cannot use a sword
		- She puts all her strength behind the sword swings
