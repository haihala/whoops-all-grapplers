This is the post-university design. The design before this one was more scattered and less focused and more difficult in terms of identity.

# Action points
- [ ] [[#Sword stance]]
- [ ] [[#Kunai 2.0]]
- [ ] Update [[Mizku]]
- [ ] Go over [[Mizku cleanup]]
- [ ] Go over animations that weren't listed


# Design
Focus areas:
- Make [[#Sword stance]] into her primary "thing"
	- This focuses her game plan around the stance
- Kunais into a secondary thing, see [[#Kunai 2.0]]
- Utilize skills learned from animating
	- Add character to the animations
	- Make them more snappy
		- Less key frames
			- More defined key poses
			- Don't care if something clips a little
		- Don't start in a neutral pose that feels sluggish
	- Highlight that she actually cannot use a sword
		- She puts all her strength behind the sword swings

## Sword stance
- Engage with qcb+f/h
- Follow-ups
	- g to [[#Sharpen]] (sped up to the point where it can be interrupted on a read)
	- f for a lunging low thrust
	- s for a [[#Rising sun]] type of swing
- Only quite little time to do the follow up before recovering naturally
	- Just doing the stance raw is kinda like a strive mfc
- Upgrades
	- Can back dash out of the stance for an evasive recovery
	- H version invincibility
		- Costs bar
		- Has invincibility from frame 1
		- More invincibility with further upgrades
	- H version amplification
		- Costs bar
		- Improves all follow
			- [[#Sharpen]] gives multiple stacks
			- Both strikes
				- Deal more damage
				- Better combo properties
				- Frame advantage
				- Push back on block to make them safer
	- Air version?

## Kunai 2.0
- One kunai per round is free
	- Starts off as a generally serviceable if not good projectile
- Upgrades
	- More uses per round
	- Control (joystick position based, maybe several levels)
		- Ability to control speed (forward = fast, back = slow)
		- Ability to control the angle (up = up, down = down)
	- A second hitbox after making contact (bomb?)
	- Air version
	- Ability to pick them back up / restock
- The point is that there are two character specific builds you can go for, [[#Sword stance]] and the kunai
