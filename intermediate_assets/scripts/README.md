# Script asset generation

This is for mostly python scripts that I use to generate various things

## generate_pinstripe.py

This generates a png file that is one pixel tall. Useful for pinstripe suit
textures, assuming UVs are fine.

## generate_skin.py

This generates a png that is a looping texture that can be used for skin.
